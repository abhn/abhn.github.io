<h1>My gear</h1>
<p>
  This page is all about tech stuff that I own, fixing common problems in them, and if you should avoid any of them in case you're considering purchasing one of these. Unless otherwise mentioned, you can assume that I approve of the stuff on this page.
</p>

<h3>Computers</h3>
<p>
  My current work / hobby setup include a Lenovo Thinkpad T14 AMD from work and a <a href="/2020/04/thinkpad-x230-in-2020.html">Lenovo X230</a> that I bought off ebay-kleinanzeigen (a local ebay for private sales in Germany), both 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage (The T14 is a much powerful with a 6 core AMD Ryzen Pro 5 cpu, full HD screen and NVMe SSD, but practically they're not very different). Both run Manjaro linux with KDE Plasma these days.
</p>
<p>
  In the past, I owned a <a href="/2015/11/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html">Fujitsu Lifebook A514</a> and a <a href="/2018/05/lenovo-thinkpad-t440-ebay-refurbished-laptop-review.html">Lenovo Thinkpad T440</a>. My work computer was a <a href="/2019/03/experiences-with-macbook-and-macos.html">2017 Macbook Pro</a>.
</p>

<h3>Displays</h3>
<p>
  I have my work monitor, a Dell U2719D 27in 1440p IPS display and another monitor that I bought myself, a Dell P2419H 24in 1080p IPS display. I hardly use my X230 with my monitors, primarily because to use both the displays, I have to use the docking station.
</p>

<h3>Keyboard and mouse</h3>
<p>
  I absolutely love Thinkpad keyboards and the trackpoint, but I think while at home I prefer my external keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is an <a href="/2020/07/ikbc-mf108-v3-ansi-unboxing-review.html">IKBC MF108</a> mechanical keyboard with blue switches and the mouse is <a href="/2020/07/logitech-g305-gaming-mouse-review.html">Logitech G305</a> budget gaming mouse. Both sit on my CSL Titanwolf desk mat which I got just to copy all the r/battlestation posts on reddit.
</p>

<h3>Sound and music</h3>
<p>
  I bought a Tribit Maxboom bluetooth speaker shortly after coming to Germany. That's still my primary music source. For video calls and outdoors, I have cheap in ears called piston fit from a company called 1more.
</p>

<h3>Storage and backup</h3>
<p>
  I got myself a WD Elements 5 TB hard drive for backing up files. I also have a 500GB spinning disk hard drive from my <a href="/2015/11/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html">first laptop from 2015</a> and the 120 GB Transcend SSD that I bought along with the laptop, both in their own enclosures. I might install Windows 10 on the 120GB SSD and use it to play games, and keep the 500 GB one for automated computer backups.
</p>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<p>
  If you are looking for a nice watch, do give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W">Casio F-91W</a> a thought. Really love it! My primary way of reading has been on screens, either my phone or the Kindle. It certainly is a more useful gift that I've received.

<p>General notes on how to get up and running with my favourite tools real quick. Also documented here are the common issues that I've faced and their mitigations. Current setup is Thinkpad T440 running Arch and i3</p>

<h3>Unresponsive touchpad after resuming from sleep</h3>
<p>
  Create a new file in <code>/lib/systemd/system-sleep/trackpad-restart.sh</code> and add the following to it. Make the file executable. It will run after each resume from suspend.
</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

modprobe -r psmouse
modprobe psmouse
</pre>

<h3>Sound and brightness function keys</h3>
<p>
  Install xbindkeys, create ~/.xbindkeysrc and do a <code>$ xbindkeys -d > ~/.xbindkeysrc</code>. Also put the following four lines in there.
</p>
<pre>

# Increase volume
"pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +1000"
   XF86AudioRaiseVolume

# Decrease volume
"pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -1000"
   XF86AudioLowerVolume

# Mute volume
"pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle"
   XF86AudioMute

# Increase backlight
"light -A 2"
   XF86MonBrightnessUp

# Decrease backlight
"light -U 2"
