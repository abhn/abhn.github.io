<h1>My gear</h1>
<p>
  This page is all about tech stuff that I own, fixing common problems in them, and if you should avoid any of them in case you're considering purchasing one of these. Unless otherwise mentioned, you can assume that I approve of the stuff on this page.
</p>

<h3>Computers</h3>
<p>
  My current work / hobby setup include a Lenovo Thinkpad T14 AMD from work and a <a href="/2020/04/thinkpad-x230-in-2020.html">Lenovo X230</a> that I bought off ebay-kleinanzeigen (a local ebay for private sales in Germany), both 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage (The T14 is a much powerful with a 6 core AMD Ryzen Pro 5 cpu, full HD screen and NVMe SSD, but practically they're not very different). Both run Manjaro linux with KDE Plasma these days.
</p>
<p>
  In the past, I owned a <a href="/2015/11/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html">Fujitsu Lifebook A514</a> and a <a href="/2018/05/lenovo-thinkpad-t440-ebay-refurbished-laptop-review.html">Lenovo Thinkpad T440</a>. My work computer was a <a href="/2019/03/experiences-with-macbook-and-macos.html">2017 Macbook Pro</a>.
</p>

<h3>Displays</h3>
<p>
  I have my work monitor, a Dell U2719D 27in 1440p IPS display and another monitor that I bought myself, a Dell P2419H 24in 1080p IPS display. I hardly use my X230 with my monitors, primarily because to use both the displays, I have to use the docking station.
</p>

<h3>Keyboard and mouse</h3>
<p>
  I absolutely love Thinkpad keyboards and the trackpoint, but I think while at home I prefer my external keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is an <a href="/2020/07/ikbc-mf108-v3-ansi-unboxing-review.html">IKBC MF108</a> mechanical keyboard with blue switches and the mouse is <a href="/2020/07/logitech-g305-gaming-mouse-review.html">Logitech G305</a> budget gaming mouse. Both sit on my CSL Titanwolf desk mat which I got just to copy all the r/battlestation posts on reddit.
</p>

<h3>Sound and music</h3>
<p>
  I bought a Tribit Maxboom bluetooth speaker shortly after coming to Germany. That's still my primary music source. For video calls and outdoors, I have cheap in ears called piston fit from a company called 1more.
</p>

<h3>Storage and backup</h3>
<p>
  I got myself a WD Elements 5 TB hard drive for backing up files. I also have a 500GB spinning disk hard drive from my <a href="/2015/11/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html">first laptop from 2015</a> and the 120 GB Transcend SSD that I bought along with the laptop, both in their own enclosures. I might install Windows 10 on the 120GB SSD and use it to play games, and keep the 500 GB one for automated computer backups.
</p>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<p>
  If you are looking for a nice watch, do give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W">Casio F-91W</a> a thought. Really love it! My primary way of reading has been on screens, either my phone or the Kindle. It certainly is a more useful gift that I've received.
