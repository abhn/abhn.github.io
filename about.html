<h3 class="nice-title">Greetings!</h3>

<p>I just keep doing things I love. I write about what I do, and sometimes, about people who annoy me. For anything, contact me at <b>abhishek[at]nagekar[dot]com</b></p>

<p><strike>I love to code applications in C++/Qt and sometimes Python</strike> It is mostly Javascript these days, learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">haskell</a> and some C for fun, lost python somewhere along the way. <strike>I also love to develop web applications, and use variety of frameworks in many languages which I am not very good at</strike> While I still love webapps, my interests have shifted to applied cryptography, secure development and privacy enhancing technologies in general. Professionally, I work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>, can create decent frontends, and do not have a cssphobia. I post my personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/abhn" target="_blank">Github</a></p>

<p>I love science, and I am always looking forward to learning anything that is new. I love sharing ideas, speaking about probability, evolution, future of life on earth and human behaviour. I love astronomy and astrophysics, and chances are, if you start a conversation with me, I will end up draging the topic to one of these. <strike> I have also recently started reading on particle physics and evolutionary biology, and consider them of my interest too.</strike> My current reading list revolves around technical books and some occasional non-technical non-fiction ones.</p>
