  I <a href="/2014/07/blogging-and-why-it-isnt-for-everyone.html">started this website</a> for writing down my thoughts for future reference. That included the things that I've learned, mostly <a href="/tags#programming">computer programming</a> related, but also some things about the way I felt about <a href="/tags#life">life in general</a>. I never thought I'd stay interested in publishing on this blog after this long. Not only has that happened, but I really enjoy writing here.
</p>

<p>
  This blog is a reflection of how I go about my life, picking up random interests and building something interesting out of it.
</p>

<p>
  Primarily those things are about computers and computer programming. I have a keen interest in engineering things in the areas of security, privacy, and anonymity. I love the world wide web and the hacker culture. I resonate with the way Richard Stallman describes hackers;
</p>
<blockquote>
  What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show <i>"Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done"</i>. - <a href="https://youtu.be/zOP1LNr70aU?t=515">RMS (1985)</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Other than that, I like and enjoy working in pretty much all areas of computers, from algorithms to web engineering, infrastructure and devops, application and networking protocols and systems programming.
</p>

<p>
  Slightly outside of all that, I love working on hobby electronics. This wasn't a huge interest until I started <a href="/tags#electronics">reusing stuff</a> to save money. Now, I find myself regularly getting my hands dirty with things like old speakers, LCD monitors, drills, soldering machines, and wood.
</p>

<p>
  I love reading about cars and automobiles in my spare time, and tell my friends that I'll someday start a garage of my own. I also love star gazing and other forms of amateur astronomy.
</p>

<p>
  I strongly believe in keeping things simple. I like it when I do things with motivations bigger than money and fame, and definitely appreciate it when others do the same. Hopefully, that is what I'd be able to say and do for a long, long time from now.

<h3>Technical setup and debugging</h3>
<p>I maintain a <a href="/setup">/setup</a> page for my current tech setup and some debug notes on how to get tricky things working</p>

<h3></h3>
<!--with change in time, I think the about page should more reflect the kind of person I am-->
<!--<p>I just keep doing things I love. I write about what I do, and sometimes, about people who annoy me. For anything, contact me at <b>abhishek[at]nagekar[dot]com</b></p>-->

<!--<p><strike>I love to code applications in C++/Qt and sometimes Python</strike> It is mostly Javascript these days, learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">haskell</a> and some C for fun, lost python somewhere along the way. <strike>I also love to develop web applications, and use variety of frameworks in many languages which I am not very good at</strike> While I still love webapps, my interests have shifted to applied cryptography, secure development and privacy enhancing technologies in general. Professionally, I work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>, can create decent frontends, and do not have a cssphobia. I post my personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/abhn" target="_blank">Github</a></p>-->

<!--<p>I love science, and I am always looking forward to learning anything that is new. I love sharing ideas, speaking about probability, evolution, future of life on earth and human behaviour. I love astronomy and astrophysics, and chances are, if you start a conversation with me, I will end up draging the topic to one of these. <strike> I have also recently started reading on particle physics and evolutionary biology, and consider them of my interest too.</strike> My current reading list revolves around technical books and some occasional non-technical non-fiction ones.</p>-->
