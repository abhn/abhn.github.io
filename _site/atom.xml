   <title>_Generic in C And Generic LinkedList Implementation</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/05/_generic-in-C.html"/>
   <updated>2016-05-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Tada! Finally a non-Javascript post for those of you who stopped visiting my blog because of my sick Js addiction. So my lost friend Aditya is back, and while talking to him, I got to read a piece of code that he wrote when we were in third semester, last year. The aim was to build a generic container to store different datatypes, in C. So yes, literally storing [21, &quot;abhishek&quot;, 3.142, &#39;z&#39;] in a single dynamically allocated linkedlist. That was pretty bold for us then.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For making that happen, he made use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)#Changes_from_C99_&quot;&gt;_Generic&lt;/a&gt; macro that C11 introducted for generic type selection. For those unfamiliar with it, I&#39;ll begin with explaining the basics of the macro. For those of you interested in the linkedlist code, scroll down to the bottom of this article. You can always check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf&quot;&gt;C11 draft [section 6.5.1.1 Generic selection pg #96]&lt;/a&gt; (the standard costs around $60 but is essentially the same thing).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 The _Generic macro follows the format &lt;code&gt;_Generic(controlling-expression, association-list)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;i&gt;controlling-expression&lt;/i&gt; is the expression whose type is to be detected, and &lt;i&gt;association-list&lt;/i&gt; is the dictionary of type-expression pairs where type can be any object type and the expression can be any expression, constant or a pointer to any function, pretty much anything that can be evaluated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To put it simply, compare it to the switch statement for type detection. For example,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
int main() {
  char *teststring = &quot;my char array&quot;; // target object
  char *type = _Generic(
    teststring,
    int: &quot;int&quot;,
    int*: &quot;int *&quot;,
    char: &quot;char&quot;,
    char*: &quot;char *&quot;,
    float: &quot;float&quot;,
    default: &quot;default&quot;
  );
  printf(&quot;%s&quot;, type);
  return 0;
}

~$ gcc main.c
~$ ./a.out
char *
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The _Generic macro can be wrapped around in a nice looking function call, say detect_type(). Compare this to a (pseudo) switch statement which evaluates the case that matches the switch params
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// Pseudocode may resemble Javascript. Reader discretion advised
var someobj = &quot;text here&quot;; // target object
var type; // to store the typename
type_switch(someobj) {
  case int:
    type = &quot;int&quot;;
  case int*:
    type = &quot;int*&quot;;
  case char:
    type = &quot;char&quot;;
  case char*:
    type = &quot;char*&quot;;
  default:
    type = &quot;default&quot;;
}
print(type)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So that is it. A compile time type identification in C with a simple macro. We can do pretty amazing stuff with it using pointers to functions. For example, a generic print function, that can take in any type of argument and print it. I have added cases for integers, characters and string, but others can be added just as easily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/3887df927f2d913c03704cac3ddaa9fc.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That was neat, wasn&#39;t it. Now back to Aditya. He used the same macro to create a dynamically allocated linkedlist. I am pasting the gist here so that you can read his beautiful code.
  &lt;button id=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;Show Code&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;vector&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;File &lt;b&gt;linkedlist.c&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/0699d92bb972320e33b3cee8f81abc23.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;File &lt;b&gt;linkedlist.h&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/6175447dd928d4c46bdc7f51b90c8b33.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;File &lt;b&gt;main.c&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/cacf3b03483759c02e997afe13aa3373.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To compile it, run &lt;pre&gt;~$ gcc main.c linkedlist.c -o linkedlist&lt;/pre&gt; on any machine with GCC installed (I&#39;ve tested it on version &amp;gt;4.9). Run it with &lt;pre&gt;~$ ./linkedlist&lt;/pre&gt; and you should see the different elements that we&#39;ve added printed on the standard out. You may also pack the linkedlist into a statically linked library, by running.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
~$ gcc -c linkedlist.c -o linkedlist.o
~$ ar rcs linkedlist.a linkedlist.o
~$ gcc main.c linkedlist.a
&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Being Stupid</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/being-stupid.html"/>
   <updated>2016-04-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/being-stupid</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  So my struggle with long distance trains doesn&#39;t seem to stop. This time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/The-Midnight-Symphony.html&quot;&gt;just like the last time&lt;/a&gt;, my train got late. By 30 days. And I am to be blamed for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Like Will Smith says in &#39;The Persuit Of Happiness&#39;, &#39;this part of my life is called &lt;i&gt;being stupid&lt;/i&gt;&#39;, after trusting a hippie with his expensive scanner and realizing how bad a decision it was. I had the exact same feelings this morning about myself. Let&#39;s rewind two weeks. I had to book train tickets for attending a wedding function at my native place, Karwar, on 29th April. As always, I did so from the irctc.co.in portal, and got three confirmed seats for May 28th. Awesome, I said, knowing how hard it is to get tickets during the holiday season. Got the confirmation email with all details and I was good to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Today, in the morining, we were all set. All dressed up and ready to start our day journey. We don&#39;t usually do day travels since it is too hot in the non air conditioned coaches that we usually book our tickets in. Anyways, it was going to be fun, I thought. Called up the railway enquiry number 139 to make sure train was on time. Surprisingly, it said the charts weren&#39;t prepared yet. Odd, because the train left the originating station a full day ago. Must be a technical glitch, I thought. Made sure I took everything; Misty, mobile phone, charger, water bottle and what not. Great. We left for our train that was scheduled to be departured at 08:10 in the morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The station is just a few kilometers away. We reached there at 8 sharp. Reaching there, I immediately started to look for the platform where our train was expected to arrive. The indicator didn&#39;t say anything. Must be a fairly new train, I thought, trying to bury the little doubt I was starting to have. Let&#39;s ask the station master, said my uncle, and so we went to the station master, to get some solid confirmation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The station master&#39;s office was a large room with a table in the center. More like a bollywood movie&#39;s police station. The man there was wearing his shirt then. We entered and he asked us what was the matter. I asked him about the status of our train, numbered 22656. He thought for a second before quicky replying that the train only ran on saturdays. Damn! That wasn&#39;t possible. I had a reserved ticket in that same train and it showed today&#39;s date. Station master asked us for the ticket. I showed him the eticket on my mobile phone. Now he was confused. He called up someone on his intercom and asked if there was this particular train running today. The other guy said the same thing, this train only runs on saturdays. Umm. Weird. Station master tried to confirm it by asking if there was any additions to its trips. The answer must have been in negative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now we three were real confused. We tried to reason the possbile explanations. &#39;Maybe the train is so new that even the station master doesn&#39;t know about it&#39;, said my uncle. Meanwhile the station master rang another number, this time of the previous station, called &#39;Vasai Road&#39;. He asked if any train with the said number had left the station or is scheduled to leave. No, was the reply. We thought for another few seconds when suddenly, with a little frustration in his decenly polite voice, the station master said, &#39;This ticket is for 28th May&#39;. I went silent for five full seconds. With my tongue stuck out, all I could say there was &lt;i&gt;&#39;sorry sir&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. I and my uncle came out silently, glad that he didn&#39;t swear at our stupidity. Okay, MY stupidity. We came out, and had the greatest burst of laughter. For him, it was funny. For me, a little less towards funny and a lot more towards the incoming embarassment. I, with my 17 years of schooling, couldn&#39;t tell May from April. Stupid. Very, very stupid. We went to where my parents were waiting. I told them, smiling and trying to make a poker face simultaneously. My mom, got so furious that she actually started to laugh. Things were pretty serious, and yet somehow, that was so stupid that no one knew how to react.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We thought for some time then, and decided to go in some other train in the unreserved compartment, which, if you know, you know the struggle and if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re pretty lucky and rich. I am still in the train, tired, sleepy and dirty with sweat and dirt all over me. I&#39;ll reach in three or four hours, and then it will be life a usual.

   <title>Googling And Asking Better Questions</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/googling-life.html"/>
   <updated>2016-04-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/googling-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Like many of the things you do in your lives, Googling is an art. Getting to the right page that you were looking for, with the right set keywords and clicking the right links, all this seems to be quite random and uncertain, but once you get into the groove, things become natural and predictable. Finding that random song you heard on the street is no big deal, and neither is finding the article that you had read couple of years ago, the only part of which you remember was the author&#39;s last name. Information is growing each day, and having the right set of tools always within you is so much important. Yes, there&#39;s that shiny history feature in you latest Chromium browser with sync, so that you never lose your tracks, but knowing how to find something on a totally random public PC without having to look into your history is very convenient, also cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  But then, you might ask, what is the point of remembering a whole new set of rules just so that I could type in proper queries on Google&#39;s homepage? Yeah, if you think about it this way, not much. Every other site has a search functionality built into it. But, think. Googling for a computer problem with &lt;code&gt;site:stackoverflow.com&lt;/code&gt; and searching the same problem on stackoverlow&#39;s search is somewhat different. Stackoverflow doesn&#39;t invest as much time on search optimization as Google does. That is the case when stackoverflow&#39;s search is one of the best you can find on the Internet. Think about others. Now, every site having its own search has its own small set of advance search syntax. Would you go around memorizing rules from each and every site that you visit? Are you not better off memorizing for just one site and using it to find everything else? In my opinion, yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And learning how to google or how to search in general doesn&#39;t just mean memorizing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking&quot;&gt;dorks&lt;/a&gt;, although it does certainly help. It generally means asking better questions. What does that mean? Well, in general, the more you research before asking a question, the more are the chances of you getting a proper and to the point answer. That doesn&#39;t just apply to online searches, but also when asking for help to your fellow classmate or colleague. The research helps in a number of ways. Firstly and most importantly, it can spare you the need to ask for help by finding the answer yourself. Secondly, research also helps to properly understand your problem&#39;s causes, such that any similar problem can be solved with the same approach. Thirdly, it creates a psychological difference in the mind of the answerer when he or she reads a &lt;i&gt;&quot;this code doesn&#39;t work&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;&quot;this code throws a undefined variable error on line 42&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;&quot;the &#39;name&#39; variable on line 42 is undefined as the async function on the previous line hasn&#39;t returned yet.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. As you see for yourself, the third problem definition is far more probable to get answered, and the first one is likely to get ignored (or worse, downvoted, if you&#39;re on StackExchange).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I have people who send me program source code files in emails and the only line of text inside of the email being the obvious title that &#39;the code doesn&#39;t work&#39;. That is where the problem lies. When all you say is &#39;it doesn&#39;t work&#39;, then the only reply that you deserve is &#39;congratulations on figuring that out&#39;. It&#39;s that simple. And to understand the importance of it, you need to value the time of others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So how does one turn from a naive help addict to his or her own problem solver? The answer is simple, know what the problem is and start searching for already answered questions. You always have documentations and manuals at your disposal, but let&#39;s face it, it is not easy to get hold of manuals if you&#39;re new to the subject. And even if you&#39;re well versed with the topic in hand, you can always save time by searching the popular forums first. So what do you do? You search for the exact problem message, or keyword, keeping it as concise as possible. Trust me, the query string is all that matters, because rarely you&#39;ll encounter a problem that somebody else didn&#39;t face and asked somewhere. You want to keep the variable count low, and so if you&#39;re learning A, use popular libraries and operating systems B and C that would keep the entropy factor low. As an example, if I&#39;m not hacking into linux core and simply programming Javascript, I prefer to use Debian and Nodejs stable, &lt;i&gt;just to make sure that when I fall into a ditch, the ditch is a popular one&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In case you still didn&#39;t get a working solution, now start to dig into documents and manuals. It is usually the case when the component that you think is broken, isn&#39;t actually broken. Look out for platform specific notes and details. Troubleshoot your way backwards to the line where your code broke. If you manage to find that out, then you know the problem. Start by making a fresh google search for that error. In most of the cases, a forum thread might have the answer, which you can find easily with [SOLVED] in their titles. There are also many instances when if you are working with an open source dependency, you&#39;ll find the issue raised by somebody on the project issues section of their repository [like github issues page]. Reading those has helped me countless times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If even then, in the rare (very rare with computer problems) case that you still haven&#39;t found a solution for your problem in the online forums and documentations, start by properly defining the problem. It is time to ask for help. Always, ALWAYS remember, the people you&#39;re asking questions to, are busy people. If you want to have a percent chance of getting your question read by experts, value their time. The essential things that must be included in every help request are,
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Precise problem definition with the problem and the current and expected results.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Steps to reproduce it. Code snippet that points the line of error (You should never paste 200 lines of code into the question).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      What have you tried yet. List of the things that didn&#39;t work out.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The platform you&#39;re running, everything relevant to the problem. More the detail, better is the understanding of your situation by the reader.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      A paste of your latest logs relevant to the error. Learn to use pastebin like sites to paste large text files.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The links to those similar problem-answers that didn&#39;t work for you.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  Add or remove things depending upon the situation. It may or may not apply every time. Important thing here is, try to be a problem solver. Don&#39;t be part of the problem, but try to be part of the possible solution. It is okay if no one answers, but hang there for the first 30 minutes at least, in case someone asks for more details that you didn&#39;t provide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This should really answer your question, and in case not, don&#39;t lose hope. There are hundreds of specialized forums that you can head to, if the problem is that important to you. Back to Googling, what is it that some people better at finding stuff on the Internet than others? Now you know the answer to that. See, this is how it generally works. Most good questions are answered. Now that you know how good questions are asked, you know what is inside them. You can make a pretty educated guess about what an existing question may contain. Now your task is as simple as just using those keywords to find that answer. This works. Trust me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Concluding it, I hope this post was informative. Ask wise questions. People really appreciate when you ask good questions. They say no question is stupid. That is not an excuse to not trying to search from the existing resources, or being a naive help addict. Keep exploring.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>WebSockets</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/websockets.html"/>
   <updated>2016-04-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/websockets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	If you&#39;re like me, then you must have gone nuts on hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API&quot;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. We now have a totally independent protocol that will not terminate connection after a request-response cycle, which means all hacks to keep a persistent connection from the browser (long polling, I&#39;m looking at you) would now be part of the history. Welcome to the world of WebSockets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&#39;s start with the Wikipedian and Mozillian definition of WebSockets, to get some initial traction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Wikipedia says that..&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mozilla Developer Network says that..&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user&#39;s browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To begin with, let us all make sure we have websocket support by clicking &lt;button id=&quot;hasBtn&quot; onclick=&quot;hasSocket();&quot;&gt;here&lt;/button&gt;. Assuming you do, let&#39;s begin. Web browsers provide us with the &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; class. To create a websocket, we simply need to &lt;pre&gt;let ws = new WebSocket(&#39;ws://server.com/endpoint&#39;);&lt;/pre&gt;This gives us a &lt;i&gt;websocket&lt;/i&gt; object which supports methods like send() and close() and event listeners like onmessage and onerror.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Creating a nodejs instance running a websocket server is easy with modules. I did try to do it natively, but it went too tedious. Finally I settled for &lt;code&gt;ws&lt;/code&gt; module from npm. The server side code looks trival.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/d94830c3901b48ebdeb8375b37d0ee60.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the browser, things are even simpler.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// call the object constructor
var ws = new WebSocket(&#39;ws://nagekar-ws.herokuapp.com/&#39;);

// attach a message listener
ws.onmessage = function(msg) {
	console.log(msg);
}

// send some message
ws.send(&#39;hello server!&#39;);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once we call the constructor, an HTTP GET request is generated to initiate the transaction. You&#39;ll find that these headers are sent by your browser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: nagekar-ws.herokuapp.com
Connection:Upgrade
Pragma:no-cache
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions:permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits
Sec-WebSocket-Key:ut0NjBQxxBnmtUStHfMUDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Version:13
Upgrade:websocket
User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/49.0.2623.108 Safari/537.36
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ones to notice are the URL, which begins with ws:// protocol. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23674199/why-is-there-no-same-origin-policy-for-websockets-why-can-i-connect-to-ws-loc#comment36372038_23674863&quot;&gt;Cross domain requests&lt;/a&gt; are allowed. This initial step requires the use of HTTP(S) or web, hence the name &#39;web&#39; sockets. The &lt;i&gt;&#39;Connection:Upgrade&#39;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&#39;Upgrade:websocket&#39;&lt;/i&gt; and what requests the server to change this connection to a socket one. The &lt;i&gt;Sec-WebSocket-Key&lt;/i&gt; header is what client sends to the server. The server crafts another key with this and returns it back in the response header. A response header looks like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols

&lt;p&gt;
	On receiving the &lt;i&gt;Sec-Websocket-Accept&lt;/i&gt; header, the handshake is completed, and now the client and server are connected via persistent sockets, ready to perform both way message delivery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Click &#39;Connect&#39; button to initiate WebSocket handshake. The server will respond with a timestamp every 2500 milliseconds. Also, the server will echo back everything to send at it. The close button will call the WebSocket.close() method which will terminate the connection.

	    &lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;button id=&quot;close&quot;&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;
	&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pretty interesting, isn&#39;t it. Things get even more interesting when you use a readymade library built on top of WebSockets, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://socket.io&quot;&gt;Socket.io&lt;/a&gt;. It supports all browsers (through fallback to XHR/polling), has better looking APIs, is easy to use and allows you to broadcast without having to worry much about raw connections. If you&#39;re going to use these WebSockets in production, there&#39;s no reason not to use Socket.io. Using native websockets is not recommended if you&#39;re planning to support some legacy browsers. Even Mozilla terms it as an &#39;experimental technology&#39;. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket#Browser_compatibility&quot;&gt;compatibility table&lt;/a&gt; for more information.

   <title>Event Driven Programming</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/event-driven-programming.html"/>
   <updated>2016-04-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/04/event-driven-programming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	I remember starting to learn Javascript. It was all a nightmare. Functions used to execute out of order and seemed very random. There was chaos all around, and I was usually left wondering, &#39;what is the order of execution here?&#39;. Of course, that question never got answered, because that wasn&#39;t the right question. The right question would&#39;ve been, what drives these functions in this code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, I asked it at an early stage. The things that make Javascript tick are called &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;events&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Without these, your browser window is just a dead canvas. Not just the browser, but other Javascript environments as well, work because of events. And when you understand it, events and event driven programming are probably the most intuitive form of developing applications. Events are not difficult to visualize, once you start to relate them to the real world events.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Suppose you&#39;re alone at your home. You&#39;ll need to make sure you open the door in case someone arrives. There are two ways of doing it. First way is to periodically keep checking if someone is outside the door, say every 5 minutes. In the best case, someone will arrive the moment you open the door, but in the worst case, a visitor has to wait for about 5 minutes before you make your next visit. This is just ridiculous. It is inefficient (visitors have to wait for you) and waste of time (when you check but no one has arrived). Who does this? Well, most procedural languages work this way. And it works, for their use cases. But when you&#39;re dealing with real life scenarios, like checking doors or handling HTML form responses in browsers, where the time of completion of an action or arrival of a visitor is unknown, a better approach has to be used, especially when time, muscle and browser resources are so scarce. Here comes event driven programming.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Suppose, you&#39;re alone again, in the same house. But this time, you decide to make use of events. You install a doorbell. Now, whenever someone arrives and rings the bell, you know you have to go open the door. That&#39;s simple. That&#39;s event driven. It doesn&#39;t matter if the next visitor comes after a minute or after an hour. You&#39;ll open the door instantaneously, without waste of your own time. And the fact that most homes have doorbells and this is our natural workflow when dealing with similar situations, is the proof of how intuitive this programming paradigm is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Okay, that was cool, so far. But I know that I have to listen to a doorbell and then on hearing it, walk to the door to open it. How do I make the machine do that. The answer is callbacks. If you are not quite sure what they are or how they work, do check out my other article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nagekar.com/2016/02/callbacks-eventloop-in-javascript-explained.html&quot;&gt;how callbacks and event loop work&lt;/a&gt;. So essentially, we attach a &#39;callback&#39; to an event. The callback, as the name suggests, calls back when the event occurs, and lets us control the aftereffect. Such a callback is also called an event listener, which infact is what you attach to the &lt;code&gt;element.addEventListener(&#39;event&#39;, callback);&lt;/code&gt; when working in the DOM. In Nodejs environment, you get a custom EventEmitter class that you can use to emit and listen to events. If you haven&#39;t heard of it, &lt;a href=&quot;socket.io&quot;&gt;socket.io&lt;/a&gt; is all about custom events and the data transfer between the client and the server. It makes use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API&quot;&gt;websockets&lt;/a&gt; along with XHRs. If you are into creating sockets and data interexchange between remote hosts like I am, socket.io is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/d5eb252e620ee157d4ab1cc49811221a.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, I hope to have given you some insights of event driven programming with Javascript. Not a lot of code, but that is something you&#39;ll find everywhere. I always like to emphasis on the concepts rather than implementation. It makes for a better implementation.

   <title>Gentoo Experience</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/03/gentoo-experience.html"/>
   <updated>2016-03-26T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/03/gentoo-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	I started using GNU/Linux full time sometime in 2011. Before that, it was all tiny bits here and there, virtualbox and stuff like that. But then, I finally made my mind to replace the Windows based OS that I was running for Linux. Trust me, it was a very scary decision at that time, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Backtrack 5&lt;/a&gt; was my first full time Linux distro. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From there, it was an ultimate goal to try out every major distro. I used Backtrack till version 5r3 when they dropped support. Then I tried Ubuntu, since I had read Backtrack was Ubuntu based. Switched to Kali Linux, for it was the latest. After that was CentOS 6. I remember using it because I had the same on my DigitalOcean VPS. VPS gone, it was time to switch. I tried Fedora, but GNOME 3 didn&#39;t appeal to me, and still at this point, I was unaware of what a desktop environment was, or how do I change one. Later I switched to Debian 7, which was when I fell in love with it. Attended the launch party of Debian 8 and started using it right away. Debian stable had some really outdated packages, and the GNOME environment didn&#39;t appeal to me either. I installed Debian testing, running XFCE. It was the setup I always needed and is still my daily driver. In the meantime, I tried OpenSUSE too, but nothing great. As you see, I don&#39;t really need a reason to switch distros.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What really provoked me was a sentence that I read somewhere, &#39;if you have not used Slackware or Gentoo, you really have not used Linux&#39;. It was 3 years ago. Since then, I had multiple tries at installing Slackware, Gentoo and Arch, but somehow, I would mess some thing up and it would be a failure. You should note here that installing these systems is not as easy a task, especially when you don&#39;t understand the commands you are typing. This time was nothing different. I downloaded the ISO which was surprisingly just some ~250MBs. I burnt it to a disk and booted it up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most scary part of it all is that there is no &#39;installer&#39;. You have to manually create partitions, the swap and the bootloader. Then there is the phase to download the &#39;stage3&#39; file to the root and untaring it. Chrooting into it, setting up a few things like network, downloading the kernel source, compiling it and adding it to the /boot directory and then the hardest stage. Reboot. Hard emotionally, that is. After a minute, you are either greeted by the login prompt, or you realize that the past 8 hours of your life went in vain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Luckily for me though, it booted up. It was after midnight when it booted up, and I was installing it since 2pm. I&#39;m a noob. It is not a lot different than other distros, if you know how to &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; softwares. There is this package manager called &lt;i&gt;emerge&lt;/i&gt; which is helpful too (it downloads sources and builds it, resolving dependencies). I am currently running it command line, as I didn&#39;t setup the Xorg during installation. It is pretty usable, and the best part is that you actually understand your system. I realized that this is a great way to actually learn GNU/Linux. The thing that I have to live with is that since each and every installation is by compiling source, it is damn slow. Usually 15-30 minutes for most applications. The plus point is that since it is build on my particular system, the executable is smaller than usual (and I read it is faster too). Cool, right?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am looking forward to using it everyday on my PC, at least for sometime till I get really good at it. Maybe then I&#39;ll try doing the same on my laptop, which would be nice. For now, I&#39;ll have to figure out a way to install Xorg.

   <title>Going Full Stack On Mobile</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/03/going-full-stack-on-mobile.html"/>
   <updated>2016-03-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/03/going-full-stack-on-mobile</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	I have been a part of numerous web projects, and after these many applications using multiple languages and frameworks, when my friend Kunal suggested that we should develop an Android application that would make use of a backend and stuff like that, I couldn&#39;t help but desperately show my excitement. I told my friends, family and even seniors about the thing I am working on. After all, it was my first time going full stack mobile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For clarifying things, I am still doing the backend. It is my little team that has gone full stack. On mobile. The application, called the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;moodShare&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will enable a user to do few simple tasks like registering, logging in, adding friends, sharing statuses, reading statuses and stuff like that. Each task is made possible with a simple API that is made without much thought to future scaling. I know, that is really bad from my side. But then, I was too desperate to get an application up and running that I neglected a lot of issues that arose when we were developing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application&#39;s backend was Mongo, Express and Node. We deployed it to Modulus.io but then this happened and we had to shift it to Heroku. 
&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:48.2886904762% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BCifT2gGkAT/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Too poor to get a proper server...

&lt;p&gt;
	And this was when we had around 4 live users. The code quality was poor, very poor. Trust me when I say it. 4 users were hitting the database around 7 times a second. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BCiVuS2GkNI/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beautiful sight of requests hitting the API server #javascript #nodejs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A video posted by Abhishek Nagekar (@abhisheknagekar) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-03-04T15:43:02+00:00&quot;&gt;Mar 4, 2016 at 7:43am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then there were many other issues as well. For example, if you added a friend who had 400 status updates in his or her name before you added, your phone would notify you, well, 400 times. Literally. That was awful. Push notification was implemented in a way you write an infinite for loop to check if something has changed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But hey, this was our first time. We did enjoy each and every second of the development (around 4 days), the bugs just as much. We did learn a lot from it. Before this project, messaging queue was just a name, Google Cloud Messaging was just another service that I knew nothing about, three or four HTTP status codes that I knew. The satisfaction of knowing more about these was worth it all. Lastly, we did not abandon the project. Our alpha version was pretty stiff and unusable. Hopefully, with better APIs, better hosting and material design on the frontend, we plan to rock with the beta version. Stay tuned.

   <title>Callbacks And Event Loop Explained</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/02/callbacks-eventloop-in-javascript-explained.html"/>
   <updated>2016-02-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/02/callbacks-eventloop-in-javascript-explained</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Callbacks are the things that make writing Javascript fun. If you think you are better off writing Javascript the way you wrote C and Java, then you are not really feeling the essence of this beautiful language. I found it rather hard to get used to this style of programming, called affectionately as the non-blocking style. What is this difficult sounding technique, and how can you make use of it to write better code is what we&#39;re going to see in this little essay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Starting with the most basic explanation of what a callback is. Suppose I have two functions A and B. Although I can execute both of them myself, what I can do is execute A and ask A to execute B for me. Yes, that is all there is to the callbacks thing. I have two functions, I execute one and then ask it to execute the other one for me. Simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But, you might ask, why I would ever want to do such a thing. Well, think about it this way. Computer processing is way, way faster than any I/O in question, especially when the I/O is on the other side of the network (or globe, for that matter) which is usual in the case of most web applications. Now, if you write code such that it queries a remote (or local) database and uses those results to carry on further processing, it results in a bottleneck. The processor executes instructions in the order of nanoseconds. An I/O request to the disk or network takes a few milliseconds at best, or a million times more time than what a processor needs to do a single atomic task. So essentially writing code that waits for results from I/O is simply wastage of the precious CPU cycles that could&#39;ve been put to better use in the meantime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A callback is also of great use when you want to make a function, say A, do things according to the context by supplying a specialized function B at the runtime. For example,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/22fa7b521b4013c30bdd.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So let&#39;s get into some (pseudo) code. We will first see what it is like to write code without callbacks and blocking IO and then examine some issues. Then we will write the same code using callbacks and non-blocking IO and see if we have rectified (or at least mitigated) those issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/6b032655b0924b0ed301.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now this code is blocked when the Javascript engine is waiting for the Mongodb query to execute and return. It may take a few milliseconds, and only after that does the control of the program moves to the next lines. If the database hangs up for any reason, then the response will never reach the end user, regardless of whether the login credentials were correct or not (or let the user know something went wrong). It may also happen that the Javascript engine continues the execution with &#39;undefined&#39; returned, resulting in falsy block being executed each time. Having addressed these problems, let us now write the asynchronous version of the same (pseudo) code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/c1f4527a33f92a304d7e.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The callback function in a way keeps waiting for the response from the database in the background white the flow of program is not interrupted. As soon as the reply comes, the code in the callback function is executed. That sounds neat. Wait a second. Didn&#39;t we all learn that Javascript is single threaded and does a single job at a time and what not? Then how is the callback supposed to listen when the browser is already executing the code below it? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To understand that, you&#39;ll have to stop believing every thing you write in Javascript is Javascript. Yes, I mean it. Javascript is single threaded, but there is much more to Javascript than just a single &lt;b&gt;call stack&lt;/b&gt;. Ok first, what is a call stack. Whenever a javascript file is executed, the engine creates a context for the code to run. This is the global execution context. It sits at the bottom of the call stack. Whenever a new function is invoked (or &#39;called&#39;), a new execution context is pushed on top of the stack. After the execution completes, the execution context is popped off the stack. After the last line of code is interpreted, the global context is popped off the stack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well and good. But what about that setTimeout function that you set for the next 10 seconds? And our own mongodb query. Where did those go? The setTimeout is actually a webAPI provided to us, the Javascript developers, by the browser. Similarly, our mongodb query command was not a Javascript thingy, but a C++ API from the Nodejs bag of goodies. These events are handled by their respective environment, and when they finish execution, they enter what is called the &lt;b&gt;callback queue&lt;/b&gt;. There, they wait until the call stack is completely empty. Once the call stack in empty (all Javascript code is done running), the &lt;b&gt;event loop&lt;/b&gt; kicks in, pushes the callback functions waiting in the call back queue on top of the stack, one by one. A great way to visualize what the above paragraph just said is to try it out yourself at &lt;a href=&quot;http://latentflip.com/loupe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;loupe by Philip Roberts&lt;/a&gt;. He&#39;s an amazing guy and you should totally check out his talks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So that was it for this little article. Hope to have helped you. Keep digging.

   <title>AJAX Loading</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/02/Ajax-Loading.html"/>
   <updated>2016-02-05T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/02/Ajax-Loading</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Edit: The section below this has some major issues, that I only found out after pushing into github. Read edit section.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I always admired the sites which did not reload upon clicking links here and there, but simple gave me whatever I requested for, with grace. Sites like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube extensively use it, and the application hardly reloads after the initial reload. Here&#39;s my attempt on making something similar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Firstly, I downloaded a free HTML template from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlinecasinos.im/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Online Casinos&lt;/a&gt;. The links had to be edited. The pattern I used was to replace, for example, any (internal) link pointing to &lt;code&gt;example.html&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;#/example.html&lt;/code&gt;. What it did was 1.) prevent the page from reloading, and 2.) putting the requested location to some place from where I can extract it with Javascript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, grab that location of the hash. The Javascript&#39;s built in method &lt;code&gt;window.location.hash&lt;/code&gt; provides the page&#39;s current hash. We drop the first char from the returned hash as it is the hash (#) character itself. The hash value is essentially the location to be navigated to, hence, we use some string manipulation to craft a new URL from it, and make an AJAX request to fetch the contents of the page requested, and insert it into the div specified through Javascript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, suppose we are on about.html page. Now if I click &#39;contact&#39; link, the link would change to /about.html#/contact.html, the hash value would be grabbed by the window.location.hash method, a GET request is fired to get that location with a XMLHttpRequest object, the response is inserted with innerHTML method on the div, and using the &lt;code&gt;window.history.pushState()&lt;/code&gt; method, we update the URL to /contact.html, to ease sharing. All this, in the blink of an eye. Cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I could do it in two different ways. One was to just place the text in those files and inserting them into the template. The drawback of this was that if a user directly visits that page, he/she would just see plain text. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/assets/ajaxreload/&quot;&gt;check this link out&lt;/a&gt;. The Javascript code for that was,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/e53b6d308f3620e7b9a2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The separate callback function for getHash was necessary because onclick() event fires before the hash is changed, and it would result in the script grabbing the previous hash. As already mentioned, the navigation is smooth if one visits index.html and then other links, but try getting the about.html page first. All you&#39;ll see are a few lines of text.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A sloppy solution to the above problem was to replicate the entire index page with varying content for each of the page, and then replace entire DOM on anchor click. You can imagine this is not at all smart, and would destroy the point of this site. Not to mention the extra bandwidth to reload the same resources on every request. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/assets/ajaxreload2/&quot;&gt;Here is the implementation&lt;/a&gt; for this method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What would be the smarter way? Perhaps, making sure the first page to load always downloads the entire html every time, and subsequent requests to be made to download the changed content. I will be implementing this solution shortly. Drop in your ideas too, and share if you enjoyed reading this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So, the above code seemed to work on my localhost, but there were some serious (cross origins and some logical ones) issues with it, so much that I considered to learn relative and absolute links all over again. Anyways, I also happened to redesign my blog during this time (redesign in the sense changing the template), and I am working to implement AJAX loading on all links here on my blog. So far, all links on the home page seemed to work as expected (AJAXified). I am using the document.write() method, so judge me on that. You can check them out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The code snippet is following.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/330dcb193dd25e46607d.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    What do you think about it? It feels a little buggy at times, and sadly, Internet Explorer isn&#39;t supported yet. But for most of it, chrome and firefox are working like a charm. Hope to get all links covered under this thing, which would be nice. Sadly though, the browser tab shows loading for all the third party resources on the page which kill the purpose of this thing. Anyways, feel free to correct or improve this in the comments below.

   <title>Exchanging Chikoos For Friends</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/exchanging-chikoos-for-friends.html"/>
   <updated>2016-01-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/exchanging-chikoos-for-friends</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    Traveling to college everyday, in a train compartment, sitting on the same seat for about an hour, your entire attention is on your phone of course. Yes, it was surely enjoyable in the early days, but after a while, you don&#39;t get to see anything unusual most of the times. That is the reason if you ever spot me in a train compartment, I would be drowned into some book or my mobile phone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was a similar day today, morning 9 am. I was sitting by the window, enjoying the newest mix-tape I downloaded. I was into my phone screen when I noticed a &#39;Chikoo&#39; seller making his way through the boogie. I glanced at him through my peripheral sight and was soon back on the phone screen. I noticed the man sitting on the other side bought some 8 chickoo for Rs. 10, &lt;i&gt;&#39;Nice deal&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, I thought, &lt;i&gt;&#39;but cannot carry them to college&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. Just then, the man, who bought those Chikoos, started distributing those in between us, the people sitting next to him. I stared at him for a second, this time a bit carefully. He was a well groomed individual, in around his late 40s. He was the typical man you find in countryside India, and his preference for white outfit depicted that well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He offered me chikoo, and I took it without any hesitations. It was real sweet. He gave away 7 of the 8 he had to the people around him, relished the one he had left in his hand, and started talking to the people, total strangers. He said that he didn&#39;t have a native place, and that makes him feel every place like his own. He chuckled. The people around him started with their stories and it was fun to hear. There were some five to six of them who were chatting like they were some long lost friends, when in fact, they had just met a few minutes ago. The smiles and the laughter I witnessed were something unforgettable. They spoke for sometime after that, while I, finding no room to add anything in those elderly talks, decided to put the music back on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It did, however, teach me how important it is to give away, and how much joy it gives to the people who receive it. I learned that I need not have a bucket full of cash to bring a smile on someone&#39;s face. It can be done with some 10 bucks too. Plus what you get are some friends, who have a great first impression of yours in their minds. It is a small price to pay for those many returns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is funny how a random incident changes your point of views to that extent. People like these exist in our World, who call the World their home, and the people their very own. The World and Mother Nature are really our very own. It is just that we often forget it in our fast paced lives. Have a great time ahead.

   <title>Private Local Cloud Storage Using Raspberrypi - How To</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/how-to-private-local-cloud-using-raspberrypi.html"/>
   <updated>2016-01-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/how-to-private-local-cloud-using-raspberrypi</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Today we&#39;ll see how you can home brew a cloud (in the local sense) storage solution that would be free to use, quite faster than an Internet based one, secure enough from any outside the network intrusion and customizable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But why do you need to go to such lengths when you can easily create an account on Google and get 15 gigs of free storage. Well, first of all, data that we generate is increasing significantly each day. We have multiple devices with us, most of them with ~16-64 GB storage, which is not at all good enough. Then while our notebooks are getting faster with solid state drives, they are still costly to use for all of our needs like storing tonnes of movies and music videos, that is, if you are still left with space after cramming up your disk with camera pictures. If you opt for a premium account at Dropbox or Google Drive, it will easily cost you ~$100 a year recurring, the cost which can get you a 2 TB WD external hard disk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then there is the speed issue. At least here in India, we are deprived Internet connection faster than 2-4 mbps. Most of the times even less than that. Even if we considered the option of backing to an online cloud storage, the bandwidth prevents us from efficiently using what already exists for free. When using an local cloud, the bandwidth is only throttled by your equipments, and most of the times you can easily get ~40-60 mbps, which is fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last issue, depending on how you see it, is the most and the least important. Security. If the files are going to be random movies and music videos, you might not be much worried about some hacker breaking into your cloud storage provider and downloading them, but on the other hand, if the files contain any kind of sensitive personally identifiable information, then you would worry. But having said that, I would always choose a secure storage solution from insecure ones if given an option, even if the data was not at all sensitive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things you&#39;ll need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that we&#39;ve discussed some merits and demerits, lets talk about building the thing. The things you&#39;ll need are,
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi (with all it&#39;s setup accessories), with Ethernet port&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Hard disk, any capacity, with SATA to USB converter&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Wireless router&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Ethernet cable or Wifi adapter&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;USB power hub [in some cases]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up the hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Connect the hard disk to the Raspberrypi&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Boot it up and login via ssh&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;i&gt;sudo fdisk -l&lt;/i&gt; and make sure the hard disk is shown. Note the device name (/dev/sdb or similar)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;If not, try usb power adapter&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;If it is showing, we&#39;ll have to make sure it mounts to the same location each time we boot up.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Create a folder for the mount point. I&#39;ll be using &lt;pre&gt;/var/www&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;It would be advisable to use a separate low privileged user for the process, since we will be changing the user home later on.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo chmod 775 /var/www&lt;/pre&gt; and &lt;pre&gt;sudo chown your_username /var/www&lt;/pre&gt; to set the permissions for reading, writing and executing.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo blkid&lt;/pre&gt; and note the uuid for the external hard disk. Copy it.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Now we need to make the mounting occur each time we boot the pi up. Open the fstab file by &lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/fstab&lt;/pre&gt; and add the following line &lt;pre&gt;UUID=&quot;3b28d90f-8805-4ec4-978d-c53ee397a924&quot; /var/www ext4 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1&lt;/pre&gt; by editing the UUID, mount location and file system and keeping other things constant.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Reboot the pi, and your /var/www should now be pointing to the external hard disk. If so, you are done with this part of the tutorial. If not, check what did you miss. Also make sure you are able to read and write files to that directory from your user account. If not, recheck the steps, Google for solutions or comment for help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up the FTP server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install vsftpd&lt;/pre&gt; to install the vsFTP server.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Open the vsftp configuration file by &lt;pre&gt;sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			The would be a lot of options. Just go through and make sure the following lines are there and not commented. If not, add them.
&lt;pre&gt;
	anonymous_enable=NO
	local_enable=YES
	write_enable=YES
	chroot_local_user=YES
	force_dot_files=YES
	local_root=/var/www
	allow_writable_chroot=YES
&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;After saving (Ctrl + x and then y) and exiting, restart vsftpd by &lt;pre&gt;sudo service vsftpd restart&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Lastly, change the user home to the FTP root, so that you&#39;ll directly get into the FTP server&#39;s root on logging into the FTP client. &lt;pre&gt;sudo usermod --home /var/www/ your_username&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If all went well, we have a 100% working local cloud storage running off our pi. Now, since not everyone would like to login with terminal each time they wish to access the cloud, I make some customizations to make it easy for even my Mom and Dad to use the cloud.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the desktop, download and install filezilla. &lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install filezilla&lt;/pre&gt; should do it on deb derivatives. Create a launcher icon that triggers the command &lt;pre&gt;filezilla sftp://myUsername:myPassword@myIP:myPort/my/root&lt;/pre&gt; which in my case became &lt;pre&gt;filezilla sftp://abhishek:password@192.168.1.10:22/var/www&lt;/pre&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/desktop_icon.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/filezillapi.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	On the mobile phones (we have droids, three of us), I used the &#39;add ftp server&#39; option in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&amp;hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ES File Explorer&lt;/a&gt; and created a shortcut on the home screen with the widgets menu. Hence, accessing the cloud was nothing more troublesome than accessing a local folder on the phone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/es1.png&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/es2.png&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/es3.png&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now I have my very own, secure, high speed cloud storage solution for all my devices and also for the family. It is really convenient and building a custom case for the thing, it looks pretty badass.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pisetup.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

   <title>Fastboot Horror</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/fastboot-horror.html"/>
   <updated>2016-01-08T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/fastboot-horror</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was the second day entirely wasted to get my external hard drive to work with the USB 3 ports on my laptop. It just refused to get detected. It worked fine on the USB 2 port, but just didn&#39;t read on the 3. Initially thought it was a Thunar issue on XFCE, but there simply wasn&#39;t any drive in the output of fdisk -l. Read up dmesg multiple times and there was this line consistently,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;[sdb] Synchronize Cache(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=DID_ERROR driverbyte=DRIVER_OK&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googled it and read every thread on the first page of the search results, literally. I had started to doubt the USB 3 ports on the notebook now. I am on Debian testing, and thought something has broken down at the kernel level. I immediately started to download openSUSE, to see if it really is a kernel bug, because I am not brave enough to switch kernels. Anyways, I thought, let me look if the BIOS is reading the drive, and boy, what do I see. The BIOS is just not recognizing the drive. Now I began to panic. It really looks like a hardware issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between my googling, I came across a page that provided some information. Some good guy had asked it for his Windows 8.1 laptop. There was an accepted answer. There were these simple steps, go to BIOS, find Fastboot, disable it. Aha! I said. How did I not think about that myself. Did it, and it was working again, like it should have. Fastboot does save a second each time I turn on my notebook, but this time, it costed me 2 full days. Lesson learnt. When the guys at elite forums say fastboot will prevent some hardware from being read and tested on boot, they aren&#39;t just putting a nominal warning on the door, that thing is real. &quot;Want to make your PC boot faster? Enable fastboot&quot;. No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>The Midnight Symphony</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/The-Midnight-Symphony.html"/>
   <updated>2016-01-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2016/01/The-Midnight-Symphony</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its 4:07am of 2nd January on my watch and I have started to feel a little sleepy, to be honest. I have been awake this long once before, and coincidently, it was on the same platform, in the same conditions, but for a different reason. This time, it is my train back home that got late. A bit too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a night owl, just so that you know. Staying awake beyond 1am is a real deal for me, unlike most of my friends and maybe, you. &quot;Hey, but all computer people work at night. That&#39;s the rule.&quot;. Well, sorry. I am that black sheep. Its been around 7 hours since I arrived on Karwar platform. I had my train at 1:28 am, which was already too late in the first place. I hardly thought I would be able to make it till 1:30, but then, here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know something amazing? The Earth rotates. And just because of that, you can sit at a place facing east, and have a large portion of the night sky pass slowly right in front of you. Super cool it feels, to watch Venus rise, followed by half Moon and then the red Mars, all surrounded by hundreds of stars, twinkling, right in front of you. The station is far off any junction, and the silence of the night is occassionally disturbed by an ongoing express train, whose whistle you can hear right from when it is kilometers away. Can you imagine the silence. The cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hardly able to type with my fingers. It is really very cold. My CPUs are at 24 and 26 degree celsius respectively, which pretty much sums up the surrounding temperature. I am wearing my napkin as a mask on my face with my hoodie on my head, to prevent my ears and nose from getting so cold that I fear touching them, seriously. In fact, when I wore the napkin on my face, my nose started to kinda defrost. Shit. That is bad. The soft breeze that comes in once in a while adds to the bone crackling cold. I had tea at 2, and the vapors that came out of the cup felt nice on my cheeks. Warm and real good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder, does every stomach makes dinosaur sounds when hungry? Mine does, and to avoid the public embarassment, I grabed some chips from a nearby 24/7 food stall on one side of the platform. Untill 12, I was constantly checking my phone for the live status of the train, covering myself with a sheet of cloth my mom caringly gave to me, trying to accommodate my back on the little wooden bench on the platform, but then I thought to use this rare moment on the platform to make a little note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Garibrath Express is just leaving the platform. I am a bit attracted to these fully airconditioned express trains. I want to travel in one too. Look at how magnificiant this one looks, damn! There are some 50 passengers with us on the platform, but what is really worth watching is the night station staff. They are functioning quietly, like an army of ants working without anybody  noticing. I just came to know some of their everyday post-mid-night tasks. The respect rose several folds. While we sleep peacefully in the midst of the night inside the cozy compartment of our couch in the Express train, these are the people who make sure the sleep isn&#39;t interrupted, and boy they are working real good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad I had Misty here with me this time. Last time on this platform, I didn&#39;t have her. I might have experienced an amazing night, but I don&#39;t have any record of that 3 year old event. The trees infront of me some 50 yards away are so quiet, you can actually see their eyes closed. It is a dense forest on the other side, with nothing for kilometers except these trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clock on the platform is the one used by railways around a decade ago, those black and white analog ones. When I was a kid, I always asked Mom why didn&#39;t the platform watch have a seconds hand. I generally don&#39;t ask such questions these days, but I get reminded of them whenever I see those pretty objects. The amazing thing about night is that people become very easy to talk to. Everyone here is going through the same mindset, and exploiting that common linkage to explore the other uncommon corners of human nature is interesting. The station master here is friendly too. He lets me look at his console which has little LED indicator lights that show incoming and outgoing traffic. His alarm bell rings when any train is incoming and he clears the route for it on his console. Pretty neat. His dot matrix printer is making some sound, similar to the one we have in our college labs, but this one here sounds sweeter. Maybe it&#39;s just me. Master also flashes green lights to trains indicating everything is alright. It feels weird to see this human interaction, inspite of the rest of the stuff computerized. The smile that the guard of the passing train gives is yet another treat. Another train is arriving. Can you hear the tracks making that typical squeaking sound. I am yet to find out what that actually is. But that&#39;s the magic of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its 4:52 and I am still writing. There are so many things that demand a mention. The Railway Police Guard standing confidently besides the still train is thinking about something. I wonder what that might be. The best thing about a railway platform is, it feels like a mini democracy. There are people from every section of the society, eating the same sandwich and drinking the same masala tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is time for my second cup of tea as well. Thank you for being with me guys, have a great weekend. See you then.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Yet Another Happy Year Passed</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/Yet-Another-Happy-Year-Passed.html"/>
   <updated>2015-12-31T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/Yet-Another-Happy-Year-Passed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Howdy folks, first of all, wishing you a very happy new year. It has been a long year, in a purely poetic sense. Life went through some major ups and minor downs, but all in all, it was a great year. I would be summarizing few of the great moments that I remember in the following paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year started with a lot of confusion. I was going great with Python, but something felt missing. I missed C. I knew C was not the right thing for me, and C++ looked intimidating. I needed something that would back me well for the code competitions I participated in, so C++ or Java seemed to be the only way out. I choose C++, for it looked similar to things I already knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ was a great choice. I got going with it quite smoothly. I learnt the fairly advanced concepts in it, and implemented some algorithms and applications using it. But the results of the coding events I participated in didn&#39;t change much. I really sucked at them, sometimes unable to solve even 1 of the 8 problems given to be solved in the 8 to 24 hour time limit. Felt ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During march, we had our college technical festival, a.k.a. Technitude. All of a sudden, I and my mate Aditya found ourselves handling two of the technical events namely &#39;Code Wars&#39; and &#39;Debugging&#39;. The events were just what they sounded like and it went fairly well. I had never before been the responsible person for any such event in the past, and executing it successfully was something I was proud of. I even made great contacts with my seniors at the same time, who later became the people who guided my with many important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Technitude was great, and tiresome. The committee members and we, the volunteers, worked hard to make it work. Things concluded with the afterparty, which sadly, I wasn&#39;t a part of. Anyways, things went pretty fast after the technitude. Fourth semester came and went in no time. I cleared it, marginally. C++ was still on, in the background. I bought &#39;The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stoustrop&#39; and started to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post-semester holidays, there were a couple of other competitions, which I failed, yet again. The C++ learning wasn&#39;t helping me with the competitions as much as I expected. Probably because algorithms was what I lacked, and not a language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around in June, the startup fever took over. More than a startup, it was for refreshing my Python skills, learning a web framework called Django, and creating my first serious RESTful application. It took about a month for me to realize that a social networking backend was not really a one man business, at least not if I wanted to build it up in under a year. I deserted that ship, and started with another application along with my friend, this time entirely in Javascript. That was when the love for Javascript took over. I realized that after all these languages I have learnt, Javascript was something different. It required my to completely empty my brain of existing rules and guidelines, and start afresh. My love for Javascript will take up an &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/Love-For-Javascript.html&quot;&gt;entirely new article&lt;/a&gt;, so I am leaving it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In around late August or September, we had our committee elections. I was elected the Technical head, and then our committee went further to deliver an amazing Engineers&#39; day. Javascript and my new startup were in the making. Later, we got Rajashree in our team, who looked at the frontend and UI stuff. We got Nikhil, who joined the frontend team. Harshal, a budding lawyer, joined us later in November. We are five now, and while we don&#39;t work as consistently these days, we still call ourselves the Cherrylogs Dev Team, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first week of October, I got the chance to develop the website of FabIndia&#39;s Cooltobeindian initiative. Although I and Rajashree did all that we could, they were not satisfied, and we did not get paid. Anyways, I will leave that for a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/The-October-Dance-With-Cool-Indians.html&quot;&gt;separate article&lt;/a&gt; as well. That incident taught me a lot of things, especially to say &#39;No&#39;. Now, I am much comfortable in saying No to people and things that I know are not going to be worth the efforts. Result? I get much more time for things that actually make me happy, the ones that are worth it, the 20% that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were submissions, practicals and examinations. I got a Laptop in late October, which was generously given to me by Vijutai, my aunt and my mom. The post-semester holidays were spent on Javscript and Cherrylogs. I and &lt;a href=&quot;http://noobhole.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kunal&lt;/a&gt; did some work, but not a lot of it. On 23rd December, I left for Murdeshwar, Karnataka. An awesome place to spend a day or two. Then I came back to my native, Karwar, and now I am here writing this post, sitting in the hall room, thinking about the wonderful year that I have just passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish you all a very happy new year, yet again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The October Dance With Some Cool Indians</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/The-October-Dance-With-Cool-Indians.html"/>
   <updated>2015-12-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/The-October-Dance-With-Cool-Indians</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really took long to write this story. I didn&#39;t feel like it was anything worth the time or the efforts to write one. But I really felt something recently. I got called up by a passed out senior from my college. He wanted me to work on a project he initiated. Although the project was fine, I didn&#39;t actually have the time to do it. I said &#39;No, I don&#39;t think I would be able to make it&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never responded in negative with people who came to me with any tasks. That is the way I was. I just wanted to get all the experience I could, no matter how inconvenient it was for me. Mom always said, &#39;but you must see if you are free before accepting some work&#39;, I would be like, &#39;Chill, I am learning&#39;. I continued that way, because maybe, I never actually had to sacrifice anything for this &#39;extra work&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was to change on 30th September this year. I got a call from a senior at night at around 10. He asked if I was willing to do web development for a company, and those guys were willing to pay too. I replied with a yes, after which I was asked to visit their office the next day, some 80KMs from my house. I even went there, to learn something about the task and quickly went on to make a rough skeleton. Pretty easy it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home and started working towards the final layouts as shown in the PSD file that I was given, extracting layers and cropping graphics, linking them in the one page application. Things were not as neat as it was expected from us, me and my design partner, Rajashree. The backend was finalized by 3rd October, my birthday. I didn&#39;t enjoy or celebrate a single second on that day, even though I had relatives arrived at my house. It was really stressful time. I was still trying to finish things up by 5th, working from 8am in the morning to 1-2am at night, constantly receiving calls from the guys to improvise, make changes and add features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 6th, I was done. Those were really stressful 5 days. I hadn&#39;t looked at myself in those days properly. I had submissions and exams coming up, and I wasn&#39;t a cent prepared. And it was not just about me, I had Rajashree taking up equal or in fact, even more efforts, facing similar situations. Finally, I gave up. Mailed them that I couldn&#39;t keep up any longer. We did not get paid, and that can either be justified or not depending on how you see it. Anyways, it was a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, I didn&#39;t learn much. But somewhere I learnt what to value. Myself and my time. It is pointless to try to do everything. You just can&#39;t. No one can. A much better approach would be to give 100% to the few things that matter the most. This was a lesson for a lifetime. Now it is just me and the things that matter. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Love For Javascript</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/Love-For-Javascript.html"/>
   <updated>2015-12-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/Love-For-Javascript</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to choosing a programming language, I am an **. I have to admit that. Nevertheless, let&#39;s talk about my new love, Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw Javascript, it looked like a great language for client side scripting. Yes, a wonderful toy in the delicate hands of an UI designer. It seemed like a little language, with a small set of grammar and pretty straight forward. There wasn&#39;t much to look at, and I found myself using the language before even understanding anything about it. That is how intuitive it was, and easy to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, I still thought I knew like 90% Javascript. What else could one think. Javascript was all but these basic loops, sloppy, forgiving syntax parser, coupled with those self explanatory event listeners that just worked. There wasn&#39;t much to think about here, so Javascript didn&#39;t even qualify as concern when working with web apps, being a backend guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changed with my introduction to Node. The asynchronous behaviour of the APIs made me wow. Node was interesting, new and fun to write. It was everything that I never thought Javascript was, but then it was Javascript. Interestingly, as I went to write more and more code in Node and Express, I began to get stuck at even the tiniest problems. Suddenly, I was surrounded with words like callbacks, closures, event loop and prototype. Felt like I got a reintroduction to Javascript, but this time, it was not a toddler playing in it&#39;s cradle, it was something of a mysterious monster, challenging me on every other step for not having taken it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent around a month on learning Js throughly. As it turned out, understanding first class functions and object literals and many other concepts, Javascript was the most interesting thing I have touched in years. I can now see all the hustle over the Internet regarding Js. Javascript is powerful, only if you think and use it that way. The language is small, with little built in libraries that seem tiny when compared to the vast set of built in methods in Python or Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I&#39;ll have to admit now, after having learnt most of the language features (finally..), that out of the many languages I have touched, Javascript is one of the most errornous language, with literally places where you shout, &#39;what on earth were they thinking&#39;, but then, language designers are humans as well, and I have learnt to ignore the bad parts. Things are going smoothly ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really love to write more on Js, but maybe when I actually have something. Till then, assume I am on it, and I would encourage you to take up learning something wonderful too, in case you haven&#39;t. See you then.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Bug Bounty Dance</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/bug-bounty-dance.html"/>
   <updated>2015-12-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/bug-bounty-dance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting with the update, I finally made myself some money with my first ever bug bounty. It was a simple logical flaw that was rewarded. I was, of course, very happy. I had dinner with my parents in a good restaurant, bought a backpack for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/2015/11/Fujitsu-Lifebook-A514-Review.html&quot;&gt;new laptop computer&lt;/a&gt;, kept some of the cash and gave rest to my mom and dad, equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bug bounty isn&#39;t new to me. I have been living in a community where it was not uncommon to read some or the other friend getting rewarded a bounty, every other day. As far as I remember, things were not like this in my early days. I started interacting with people in cyber security in early 2011. At that time, there were no bug bounty hunters. Some of us were into defacing websites and getting root of web servers for the fun of it. Others were more into blogging about the same. Blogs written on hacking tutorials, news updates and tool guides were dime a dozen. In fact, that was the only way in which most of the amateur pentesters could make some money out of their knowledge (see Adsense and link exchange).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the old friends, the &#39;Killerz Hackerz Zone&#39; group we had on Facebook, where we had some helpful people, who used to guide everyone when needed, and were excellent people to talk to. A particular friend I remember had the handle &#39;Dexter India&#39;. He was virtually my brother. There were others too, teaching and learning from each other. After a while, I was made admin of that group, which was, for me, something extraordinary. I learnt a lot from people there, about what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; really is, and most important of all, how to keep digging to get what we want. There was this thing written in the group&#39;s description that read &quot;Don&#39;t be smart, be sincere. Then you&#39;ll become a hacker&quot;. A simple statement, but how true that was. It was from that time on, sincerity towards self that became a goal in my life. Learn, not for family, nor friends, nor in the least for society, but for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were cyber wars, defacements of thousands of sites which included the top government ones. My group vanished. Friends, whom I knew by their handles, fell off the grid. I never got to hear from them again, till date. At some point in around late 2012, everyone realized at once that these cyberwars ain&#39;t helping anybody. It stopped, and the age of hunting bugs for bounty and hall of fame began. It was something new altogether. Spend your time and skills finding bugs and shortcomings in sites that offer to pay for the bugs you report them. The payouts are usually quite high, and if done consistently, much higher than what the average engineering and business school joe gets as a salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This triggered a race between researchers, which for most of them, somehow got converted from finding the deepest flaws to finding the hidden low hanging fruits that make a quick buck and take less time to find. Suddenly, it wasn&#39;t about the skills one had. It was all about who gets it first, that gets the bounty. And when a simple bug gets you around 500 in US$s, critical ones going well over few thousands, there was no reason to not invest time in this new business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn&#39;t. I simply lacked the guts and determination to test an application thoroughly. Maybe it was the skills that I didn&#39;t have. Whatever it was, I used to always get excited to read about bounties. It was raw money, for your time. I had, at times, tried to test an application, but never succeeded. Maybe that&#39;s why I moved from web security to web development. Right down my alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then later in July this year, my mate &lt;a href=&quot;http://noobhole.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kunal&lt;/a&gt; got rewarded for a cross site scripting bug he found in a popular social network. It was a respectable sum of money, which he used to build his own PC. You know the thing with money? You don&#39;t fall for it&#39;s greed until you see the possibilities that arise from having good sum of money in your pocket. No one wants to just have loads of cash. It is the things that you can do with it, makes you want it. Similar was the case with me. I needed funds to fulfill some of my long term materialistic dreams. That was the sole motive behind &#39;researching&#39;. No, it wasn&#39;t to learn or anything, or test my skills (giggles), it was just the pure greed, that I have now tasted. Although not an awful lot, it was enough to get me a few things. Now I crave for more. Suddenly, the needs have increased. Branded bag, a prestigious phone, ultrabook. Damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote is still stuck on my mind. I miss those days badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Don&#39;t be smart, be sincere. Then you&#39;ll become a hacker&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <updated>2015-12-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/vim-cheatsheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Started using vi, although the only reason is it being light weight [I am taking a leap of faith, hoping that it will increase my speed after some practice, as most vi gurus say]. Let me first admit it. Vi feels awful in the beginning. It is really intimidating, and I am having a hard time to remember the commands and stuff. Hence I started writing the commands I learn from google and stackoverflow in a file. Thought to post it here, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep the list updated as I learn more and more commands and tricks. It serves me as a reference, and hopefully will do the same for some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Open file&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;code&gt;vim file.js&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Swtich to insert mode&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Switch to append mode&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Switch to command mode&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[ESC]&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Save file&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:w&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Save and exit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Exit [if no changes were made]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:q&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Exit, discarding changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:q!&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Moving through text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;h - left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;j - down&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;k - up&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;l - right&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Undo last operation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Copy current line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cut current line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Paste last copied line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Select text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[CTRL] + v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Search and replace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:s/pattern/replacementString&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Working with multiple files&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Next file&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:n&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Previous file&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B012Z67QTE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=B012Z67QTE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abhisnagek-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fujitsu Lifebook A514*&lt;/a&gt;. I had a strict low budget of INR 20k and I had to squeeze the most out of that. I don&#39;t play games, nor do I watch movies and hence I could cut on the graphics card and hard disk space. A powerful processor was also not much necessary. All I needed was lots of RAM and a speedy disk. I got that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Main Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intel i3 4005U 3rd Generation 1.7Ghz Dual Core (4 threads)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8GB DDR3 1600Mhz RAM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;500GB HDD 5400rpm SATA III (Which I upgraded to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00A1ZTZOG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=B00A1ZTZOG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abhisnagek-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;120GB Kingston SSD*&lt;/a&gt; worth INR 3,400)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15.6in anti-glare display 1366x768&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comes with no OS, clean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VGA, HDMI, 3 USB 3.0s and 1 USB 2.0, SDHC, Mic, 3.5mm, DVD-RW, Gigabit Ethernet, Wifi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looks great, feels sturdy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Indicator LEDs, SSHD slot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop looks beautiful on the outside. The plastic feels premium, not glossy. It has a brushed metal finish, with a sparkling Fujitsu logo right at the back which looks fantastic. On the right, you have a DVD drive, earphone and mic jacks and a USB 2.0. On the front, there are some usual indicator LEDs and a SDHC reader. On the left there is a physical lock, ethernet, VGA, HDMI and 3 USB 3.0s. One of the 3.0s is an always on anytime charge USB, meaning that you can connect your phone to it and it will get charged even if the laptop is switched off. Overall the notebook is just like any other notebook, with most of the default functionalities and you won&#39;t miss on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fujitsuA514/20151125_204547.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fujitsuA514/20151125_204651.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fujitsuA514/20151125_210705.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fujitsuA514/20151125_210713.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On opening the lid, you&#39;ll notice a somewhat odd placement of keys. For example, the right Shift key is smaller that usual, and a double pipe (&#39;|&#39;) key is present in that place. The Enter key is a little odd shaped too. Apart from these little changes, everything is pretty standard. A power button, web cam, trackpad (larger than average). The screen is not that awesome, but pretty common for something at that price. Viewing angles are average, and it becomes hard to see beyond about 30 degrees on either side. Brightness is, too, average. The anti-glare thing works, but don&#39;t expect it to perform extremely good under the sun. The overall built quality is above average, and can easily match the slightly higher ended models from HP, Lenovo and Dell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fujitsuA514/overall.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning the device on for the first time, you will be greeted with a message to install an operating system. I went with Debian Jessie. Boot up times were good, and the laptop felt snappy. The performace is good if you are not much into graphics and animated stuff. I haven&#39;t tested it but GNOME felt smooth and XFCE is, of course, lagless. There was no problem finding drivers for Wifi (you can actually just apt-get them), and sound was smooth too. Pulse ran without a problem, and though the sound of the notebook speakers is not an awful lot, it just works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting SSD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fujitsuA514/bench.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I replaced the stock 500GB hard disk that came with it with a Kingston 120GB solid state drive. My needs were not a lot of disk space, but a fast disk. The benefits can be seen right from the time you install the OS. It takes about a third of the time to get the OS installed and I was done with Debian stable in under 15 minutes. The boot up time went down from 15-20 seconds to 3-4 seconds. Is it worth to go for an SSD and sacrifice on disk space? Well, it depends. Do you do a lot of compiling, I/O and work with Intellij IDEs, Android Studio and stuff? Do you not care about backing up important data like photos, songs and movies or have a secondary storage device for it? Your productivity increases on a fast system (which is pretty obvious)?. You are not planning to dual boot it? If all or most of your answers to the previous questions are yes, then you can say it is time to invest in an SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lastly..&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery life is good. I had it running for about 3 hours and the battery has gone down from 100% to 64%, doing all kinds of stuff like installing softwares off the internet and the like. The laptop is producing very little heat, probably due to the low clock of the CPU.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think Fujitsu is a great brand which I realized after getting my hands over it. Maybe like most of you reading this, I was quite skeptic about putting 20 grands on a company which I had not heard much about. I would have well settled for a &#39;reputed&#39; brand like HP or Dell with half the features, but I risked it a bit, and in the end, I am extremely happy about me choice. If you are at a stage where you are not able to decide whether or not to go for this brand, I hope to have given you an answer. This review is for those like me, who buy smartly, decide which product to buy, read reviews and stuff online, before handing over their hard earned money to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a thought? Drop it in the comments below. Peace&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Guide To Online Passport Application In India</title>
   <link href="http://www.nagekar.com/2015/11/Guide-Passport-Application-India.html"/>
   <updated>2015-11-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://www.nagekar.com/2015/11/Guide-Passport-Application-India</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you read my recent posts, you know I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/2015/11/Passport-Office.html&quot;&gt;passport office&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of document verification. It went as smooth as it could, but before all this, before submitting the form, I didn&#39;t have the slightest clue what all I had to do, and I learnt most of the technicalities from various sources on the Internet. So here I am, writing this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three parts to this guide, as well as the entire process. Firstly, there is the online &lt;i&gt;form filling&lt;/i&gt; part, followed by the &lt;i&gt;onsite documents verification&lt;/i&gt; and lastly the &lt;i&gt;police verification&lt;/i&gt;. Before you get into the process, make sure you have some documents. Documents that are required vary person to person according to your details (you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/docAdvisor/attachmentAdvFresh&quot;&gt;document advisor&lt;/a&gt; on their official website), but you&#39;ll basically need one proof of date of birth, one residential proof and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/onlineHtml/NonEcrDocuments.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Non ECR&lt;/a&gt; category proof. Ideally, you should keep at least 2 of the former two proofs handy (You&#39;ll know why in a moment). For most of you reading this, the Non ECR would mean SSC (matriculation) certificate. Yes, that is all. In my case, I had my birth certificate as the proof of date of birth, BSNL landline bill as the residential proof and matriculation certificate as the proof of non ECR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Form Filling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handy tip; Since the form is quite large compared to other forms you might have filled and requires your attention, if you happen to take a break while filling in the form, you can click the &#39;Save my details&#39; link at the bottom of the page to save your progress in case of any failure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/welcomeLink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Passport India&#39;s website&lt;/a&gt; and click &quot;New User Registration&quot; link. Create an account on the following page. NOTE that this is just an account so the details here are of little value.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After setting up the account and verifying the email address, go to &#39;Applicant&#39;s Home&#39; and select apply for a fresh passport. You will be presented with options to either download the form or fill it up online. Since you are reading this article on the Internet, you can freely select the &#39;fill online&#39; option.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passport Type:&lt;/b&gt; You should select the &#39;fresh passport&#39; radio button, since this is your first application. Otherwise, accordingly. The type of application can be any one of &#39;normal&#39; or &#39;tatkal&#39; depending on your need, and so is the option for passport booklet size. It will increase the total cost of the application, if you go for them. I kept it to normal and 36 pages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applicant Details:&lt;/b&gt; Add your personal details here. Triple check everything for spellings and numbers. It will save you a lot of headache. Try to enter as much information as possible, and also cross check if the same details are present on your document proofs. Give special attention to spellings in your name.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family Details:&lt;/b&gt; Fill in your family details. Same instructions as that for applicant details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Present Residential Address:&lt;/b&gt; Fill in your address, and make sure it matches with the one on your bills and other documents that you are planning to submit at the passport office. You&#39;ll need to provide previous address proof if your current address is newer than 1 year (i.e. you are living in your current residence for less than 1 year)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emergency Contact:&lt;/b&gt; Person to contact in any case of emergency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;References:&lt;/b&gt;People in your neighbourhood who can confirm your identity and address, like friends, relatives or any neighbours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next few pages should be usual form filling, and doesn&#39;t carry much information weightage, compared to the previous sections. Once done, verify the details of your passport. Verify it again, and ask someone else to do it too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Verify the self declaration, and when sure everything is all right, submit the application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will do for now. Your application is filled and ready. Now you can browse to the &#39;View Saved/Submitted&#39; applications and your application should be there. There are some things that you can do from here. First of all, you will have to &#39;pay and schedule the appointment&#39;. If you had been following as per the normal procedure, you should have an invoice of INR1500 here. You can either pay online or as a chalan from SBI. I would, of course, recommend you to pay it online, and save yourself the hassle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The payment process is similar to any online transaction. No surprises here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After the payment, the system will show you available appointment dates and their locations. Select one from those, or you can schedule it later. Select the nearest one and note the exact time. They don&#39;t tolerate latecomers and you would have to reschedule the appointment if you miss it, even by 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After confirming the appointment date, take a printout of the application, get your documents attested with 2 copies of each.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are now ready for the next step, visit to the PSK - Passport Seva Kendra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passport Seva Kendra&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depending upon how far you stay from the PSK, try to reach the place at least 30 minutes ahead of reporting time. PSK will have an ATM machine, snacks counter, zerox machine, PCs with Internet access and washroom, in case you were wondering. Make sure you carry the application letter&#39;s copy, document proofs (original and attested zerox), extra documents that you have.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the documents handy. When it is time, you will first be checked by the security for valid documents and application letter, along with other security stuff. Only the applicant is allowed inside the PSK, unless there is a special exception or your applicant is a minor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After you get inside the PSK, you should notice queues, with some marked &#39;tatkal&#39;. Get into the non-tatkal queue (of course, if applicable). You will be asked to show your originals and zeroxed documents. The person at the counter should inspect them and put them into a folder marked &#39;confidential&#39;. Along with it, you will receive a token slip. Keep it infront of you and note the token number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next up, you will be waiting for your token number to appear on the screen. When it appears, note the associated counter number (like &#39;A13&#39;) carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counter A:&lt;/b&gt; Here, you will have to show your documents. The person at the counter will assess them, ask you to add something if something is missing and point out other errors. It is likely that you will get stuck at this stage if there are any problems with your documents. If not, then you&#39;ll be asked to smile for a photo, and give away your finger and thumb prints. You&#39;ll also be asked if you would like to have SMS alerts for further notifications at INR35. Get it if you need, although not necessary. If all goes well, they&#39;ll ask you to move to the next counter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counter B:&lt;/b&gt; Same procedure goes here, only the document verification is done strictly at this stage. Every detail is cross checked line by line, and errors are noted. You&#39;ll be told if you have any errors that need to be taken care of. Otherwise, you are good to go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counter C:&lt;/b&gt; Here, the person will check the originals lightly, question you a thing or two if there were any errors at the B or A counter, and if everything goes right, the person will keep your zeroxed documents&#39; folder and ask you to submit the token slip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit the token slip at the next counter, and you will receive an acknowledgement stating the status of your application, and the token slip back. Fill in the feedback form on the back of the token slip, and submit it to the exit security.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your acknowledgement form reads &#39;&lt;font style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;status: granted&lt;/font&gt;&#39; then it means all went well. You can return home and wait for the call from your local police station for police verification. In case it doesn&#39;t, then the exact error will be written. Rectify those and visit the PSK on the given appointment date, and get your application granted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Police Verification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are done with things from your side, you can wait for a call from the police department of your area. Meanwhile, you can visit your profile and click &#39;track application status&#39; to check on what stage your application currently is. During this time, authorities will inspect your civil/criminal records and stuff like that to make sure you&#39;re a good citizen. It should not be a problem for most of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This section will be updated with more details as soon as I go through this phase.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you are done with the police verification, the police will send the recommendations back to the passport office. It would contain details and depending on those, they&#39;ll further enquire and review your application or they will send the passport to print. If the latter is the case, then you can expect your passport within a month via speed post.&lt;/p&gt;
