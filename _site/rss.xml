                <title>Blog Moved To Github</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Take a look around. Everything&#39;s changed. Yet again. I am sure you&#39;re probably sick of me changing the total appearance of this blog every 3 months or so, and you&#39;re right in being so. Let&#39;s go back into a little history. Around a year from now, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Ghost blogging platform&lt;/a&gt;. It was clean, neat and beautiful. I knew I always wanted something like that to write. I didn&#39;t have this &lt;i&gt;(nagekar.com)&lt;/i&gt; domain at that time. I went ahead and started their trial, which gave me a subdomain at &lt;i&gt;ghost.io&lt;/i&gt; to blog on. It was beautiful, visually and the overall experience. After having dealth with most of the popular opensource PHP content management systems like Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal, this was something new altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I registered this domain, about a week later and started using their minimal plan of $5 per month, which included 10k pageviews. It took me not long to realize that I could&#39;nt afford those $5 because, 1) it was a personal blog from which I wasn&#39;t making any revenue, and 2) because being a student, I have to save money to utilize in other areas like books and all. I got off there, with the half dozen articles I published while I was there for a month and a half. I, with those articles in my backpack started wondering like a hunter, looking for a new shelter, cheap and simple. &lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtle.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt; was another platform that I liked, unfortunately I didn&#39;t have an invite at that time, and even when I got the invite, the custom domain feature, which I needed, was only available to paid customers. Of course not everything can be free, and I have no complaints, rather I am grateful to them for such a wonderful platform. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/2014/07/ghost-vs-blogger-view.html&quot;&gt;I had to settle for Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, as the forced ads in Wordpress were something that made me hate Wordpress.com. Initially, with a custom theme, a little complicated, but later reverted to simple one. Then I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/2015/06/creating-custom-blogger-template-from.html&quot;&gt;code my own&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be successful, as far as my goal was concerned. It was perfect. No foreign code and nothing that increased the load time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with near perfect things. They are boring. And so, I thought, was my blog. No new problems to troubleshoot and no commandline to work with. Blogger is everything what a writer sometimes needs, but we computer people are a different breed. We need problems, then be it in our own personal blogs. While randomly surfing, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a blog-like platform created to be used with Github, to publish static pages. I knew not much about how Ruby applications are, or how to set one, but thanks to their excellent documentation, I was able to set it up in less than a day. There is no database, simple text files which become posts and pages. Github automatically parses markup or markdown in the post, and you have a nice little blog which is free, easy to manage and test locally, everyone can see the source, plus new stuff can be published with a mere git push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the way the blog looks and feels. It is important for me to like it since I mostly blog for selfish reasons, haha, but I hope it is comfortable for others to navigate too. I would like to hear anything regarding the new look of my blog down in the comments, and constructive suggestions are welcome. Keep visiting.&lt;p&gt;

                <title>Love For Graphical User Interface</title>
                <description>I considered myself a &#39;programmer&#39;. One who can make stuff happen, put it on paper, my thoughts and use it as a framework to create working stuff in the digital world. As any programmer, I learnt to write command line programs first. What are command line programs, you&#39;d ask. Well, a Command Line Interface (CLI) is an interface which reacts to not visual, but textual inputs from the keyboard. You never need a mouse to work with a command line, of course, if you&#39;re skilled with that particular type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Command lines were the only way people worked with computers in the past. It was a time when the other name for people who worked with computers was programmers and hackers. No one else had the time or skill to learn and master the complicated systems. But like everything, it changed. Back in 1973, we had the first computer system that ran a GUI, or Graphical User Interface. As it sounds, yes everything was now controlled by pointing device, better known to us as a mouse. This was the onset of computers for the non programmers. Now, everyone could learn how to make computers do stuff with few &#39;clicks&#39;. We never actually looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But same was not true for people who program the computer. Programmers still and will always prefer the command line interface for most simple tasks. There are actually some tough reasons for this statement. Mainly, although the task to master CLI tools is not easy, once you do it, it feels much more comfortable than to use the every changing GUI. Not to mention the low resources that are required to run these utilities, and consistency over different platforms or operating systems. As an example, I can write a CLI tool in Python and C++ to run on Windows and Linux, and you won&#39;t be able to spot the difference between the four instances. Can I do the same with GUIs? No, at least not right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the above few reasons, I never gave a thought to learning GUI programming, in any language. You don&#39;t want to do something that is of no use to you, right? Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After been coding for sometime now, I gave a thought to why some people who are not very good programmers, succeed more than people who are great programmers. It was a thing that deserved a thought. After reading several success and failure stories on Medium and Quora, I was convinced that there is no lack of skill in any field on this planet. Take anything for example, like I thought about C++. The language I am getting better at everyday, people have been learning it from the past 30 years. Who am I challenging? It struck me that mastering some form of art (yes, programming is as much an art for me as astronomy) and creating something that people use, are not necessarily same sets. Though there is a large area of intersection, you can&#39;t be sure that just being good at something will make you successful, whatever that word means here. It was good time for me to stop thinking about how good of a shot I am at programming, and start focusing on what the world actually needs that I can provide or produce, if at all I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the time I realized, CLIs are great, but if you want everyone to use your thing, you need to give them something they will love. You need to help them in a way that they are able to use the help. How did I expect everyone to love the CLI just because I think it is cool and looks all black and white (well, that&#39;s what I think is cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone is a nerd. Not everyone has to be one. The world is so diverse. It is really satisfying to see an artist painting, a drummer performing and an athlete giving his best. It is this diversity, in us, the animals and the plants as well that makes our home, the Earth. We, geeks and nerds are no different. We love making stuff that work to our command. But we, like every other human present, also has the morale duty to help others with the stuff that excites us. Just as a painter sells his paintings, not only because he wants to earn from it, but also because he wants his art to spread, so that somewhere in a living room of some house, the hosts always get asked, &#39;where did you get this masterpiece from?&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a very different joy in seeing your creation being used. It is something different than doing what you love. Yes, it really is different. It brings the best out of you, a kind of motivation. I wanted to make something like that. I wanted to write GUIs. I took up learning it about a month ago, and I am kind of comfortable with Qt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of frameworks for writing GUIs, as anybody using a computer today can imagine. Plus, many high level languages provide APIs to write graphical applications within the language libraries, Java for instance. Still, having done some programming in C++, I had two basic options open in front of me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikivs.com/wiki/GTK_vs_Qt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GTK+ and Qt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129355/what-is-difference-between-gtk-and-qt-applications&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I choose Qt&lt;/a&gt; after reading some &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9441127/gui-development-qt-vs-gtk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;articles on Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; from users with similar dilemma. Qt is cool, lots of possibilities and support. Code is quite portable, and an important thing, I am enjoying it, which matters a lot, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;If you wonder where am I right now with it, I am writing a GUI wrapper for the GNU&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dd utility&lt;/a&gt; which should make it simple for someone who&#39;s just started using GNU/Linux to burn ISOs to disks, without the hassle of setting up a more than required complex tool or destroying the data trying to use dd from the command line by messing up the &#39;if&#39; and &#39;of&#39;, for example.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sppW3p-8Aug/VZacFriakLI/AAAAAAAAH_E/LTauqZAYW2E/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2BFriday%2B03%2BJuly%2B2015%2B-%2B07%253A57%253A13%2B%2BIST.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sppW3p-8Aug/VZacFriakLI/AAAAAAAAH_E/LTauqZAYW2E/s320/Screenshot%2B-%2BFriday%2B03%2BJuly%2B2015%2B-%2B07%253A57%253A13%2B%2BIST.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Neat, huh? Haha. I will put it up once I finish it, but the important thing is, I could do it. The best part about being a programmer is, adapting is too easy. At least when beginning. And that is mandatory, given the ever changing world of Information Technology.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ll conclude this long post here. If you made it till here, then a big thank you. I feel it is hard to read what I write, because I tend to write my feeling, and mostly they don&#39;t look the same on paper. Nevertheless, do tell me what you think about this article. Liked it, hated it, anything.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <title>Creating Custom Blogger Template From Scratch</title>
                <description>Although when I started with it, I hardly knew anything about a blogger template, but it turned out, designing a blogger template is easier than designing a HTML template. Just a few basic concepts and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, before digging into the template code, we will look at the grammar needed to code our thing. This simple article assumes you can read basic HMTL, CSS and XML. Nothing above the basic level, plain simple stuff. If not, whenever you do not understand something, make sure you search that term or tag on &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3schools.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;w3schools&lt;/a&gt; to understand it. Yes, that&#39;s all you really need, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Planning the layout&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, how do you want your blog to look like when it&#39;s done. Just a basic idea would do. You must know what you are working for. Here is what I made. It is the way most simple blogs look like. Two column layout, a header on top and a footer at bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#999;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999;color:#444;background-color:#F7FDFA;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999;color:#fff;background-color:#26ADE4;} .tg .tg-vpsr{font-size:26px;text-align:center} .tg .tg-szh5{font-size:26px} .tg .tg-n27c{font-size:26px;background-color:#bbdaff;color:#343434;text-align:center} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot;&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-vpsr&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Header&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-szh5&quot;&gt;Blog Posts                        &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-szh5&quot;&gt;Sidebar&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-n27c&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Footer&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the most interesting table, yeah I know. HTML tables, not really my thing. But this is what our end result should look like, structurally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Basic Structure &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These few lines make up a basic web page. You will see that this is quite similar to what we&#39;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;And this is how a basic blogger template looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;html b:version=&#39;2&#39; class=&#39;v2&#39; expr:dir=&#39;data:blog.languageDirection&#39; xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#39; xmlns:b=&#39;http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b&#39; xmlns:data=&#39;http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data&#39; xmlns:expr=&#39;http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr&#39;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;data:blog.pageTitle/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[ /* CSS here */ ]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Blog elements here --&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty neat, isn&#39;t it? Now, the elements of a blogger blog.  Blogger is built upon XHTML, and uses the same for retrieving and displaying data from the database. A basic block of a blogger template is called a template. So all of these are sections.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#999;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999;color:#444;background-color:#F7FDFA;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999;color:#fff;background-color:#26ADE4;} .tg .tg-vpsr{font-size:26px;text-align:center} .tg .tg-szh5{font-size:26px} .tg .tg-n27c{font-size:26px;background-color:#bbdaff;color:#343434;text-align:center} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot;&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-vpsr&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Header&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-szh5&quot;&gt;Blog Posts                        &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-szh5&quot;&gt;Sidebar&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-n27c&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Footer&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;And you have to define each &lt;i&gt;section&lt;/i&gt; before you add &#39;&lt;i&gt;widgets&lt;/i&gt;&#39; to them. A basic section block looks like this.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;b:section id=&#39; &#39; class=&#39; &#39; maxwidgets=&#39; &#39; showaddelement=&#39; &#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:section&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;where &lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt; is any unique identifier (for CSS and JS later) and &lt;i&gt;class&lt;/i&gt; value is used to tell blogger where do we plan to place this section. &lt;i&gt;Maxelements&lt;/i&gt; is the maximum number of &#39;widgets&#39; we can add to this section. Generally, it is useful to limit the number of widgets in header and footer to one. &lt;i&gt;Showaddelement &lt;/i&gt;is that &#39;Add gadget&#39; link you see in the layout window. It takes boolean value &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.    Now there are &#39;&lt;i&gt;widgets&lt;/i&gt;&#39; that go into these sections. Every separate component that you see on your blog is a widget. The &#39;blog posts&#39; is one widget, &#39;blog archive&#39; is another, and so on. These widgets can be directly added from the graphical layout tab in the control panel of your blog, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to know how to add them manually, does it?    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;b:widget id=&quot;HTML2&quot; locked=&quot;false&quot; title=&quot;Some Title&quot; type=&quot;HTML&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;Similarly here,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;id&lt;/b&gt; - is just an unique ID&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;locked&lt;/b&gt; - can the widget be moved around, in the layout tab? (yes or no)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;title&lt;/b&gt; - The title that will be displayed on top of the widget&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;type&lt;/b&gt; - One of the many basic types that blogger supports (html, blog, feed, header etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;For example, your &#39;blog posts&#39; widget will be something like this    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;b:widget id=&#39;blog1&#39; locked=&#39;true&#39; title=&#39;&#39; type=&#39;Blog&#39; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;That&#39;s it. Add it to the template and blogger will fill it with auto-generated code you need not care about.    This was all for the basics. Let&#39;s start with some code now. I am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; to save myself from writing unnecessary CSS. First thing you do here is enclose the entire body in either &lt;i&gt;container&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;container-fluid&lt;/i&gt; div.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;container&lt;/b&gt; - for fixed width layout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;container-fluid&lt;/b&gt; - for dynamic body width&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I personally prefer fixed. This is the code so far. I added container class to the &amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt; which we can (and will) customize later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;html b:version=&#39;2&#39; class=&#39;v2&#39; expr:dir=&#39;data:blog.languageDirection&#39; xmlns=&#39;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#39; xmlns:b=&#39;http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b&#39; xmlns:data=&#39;http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data&#39; xmlns:expr=&#39;http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr&#39;&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;data:blog.pageTitle/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[ .container { }&amp;nbsp; ]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b:skin&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&#39;container&#39;&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now add the divs for header, post area, right sidebar and footer and corresponding CSS classes.

Extra efforts are needed to make the template responsive. Since we already have Bootstrap, that is not a big deal either. I must conclude this post now, and for mobile friendly site, I may write an article soon.    Also, there is no SEO in this template. You must add relevant &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; tags to make your blog more search engine friendly. You can always override CSS rules of bootstrap by writing your own in the &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;b:skin&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; section.    Thank you for reading! </description>

                <title>TechMax Publications - Plagiarism Check</title>
                <description>I study for my finals from various sources, the Internet, class notes and some reference books. This time though, I had this &lt;a href=&quot;http://erp.techmaxbooks.com/PublisherBookList/BookDetails.aspx?kayMkNnwpPya//Mnxx+KW2tpeIIYHMDUJ1VBQqCfT3k=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Computer Graphics, by Sanjesh Pawale, Techmax Publications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The books from this publishing house are everything what a Mumbai University guy needs to study for exam. Well, not exactly, but that&#39;s how most see this book as.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I was reading it, I noticed that much of what I read in the book was something I already read someplace else. A quick browser history lookup revealed that the stuff were taken from Wikipedia. Wait, let me rephrase it, &lt;i&gt;the stuff were copied and pasted from Wikipedia&lt;/i&gt;, including the text, images and caption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your information, the content of Wikipedia is licensed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creative commons attribution share-alike 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. The license states that &lt;i&gt;the usage is unrestricted. even for commercial use as long as appropriate credits are given and indications of modifications are made. Moreover, the content, modified or original, must be distributed under the same license&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o2NrEFeVaTk/VXvSyB6nXsI/AAAAAAAAH9w/ecQdEWU-Q2A/s400/Screenshot%2B-%2BSaturday%2B13%2BJune%2B2015%2B-%2B12%253A19%253A21%2B%2BIST.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But there&#39;s a bummer. The content copied by Techmax shows no attribution, no credits to Wikipedia or it&#39;s authors, and the worst, they have copyrighted the book under their name and it&#39;s totally restricted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LqaJb18LxKc/VXvW0H6f4AI/AAAAAAAAH98/gfdg6JMMOzY/s1600/20150613_122354.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LqaJb18LxKc/VXvW0H6f4AI/AAAAAAAAH98/gfdg6JMMOzY/s400/20150613_122354.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here is a piece of text from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;To re-distribute text on Wikipedia in any form, provide credit to the authors either by including a) a hyperlink (where possible) or URL  to the page or pages you are re-using, b) a hyperlink (where possible)  or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible,  which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the  authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or  c) a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to  exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;So it is mandatory for TechMax to provide a backlink to the webpage they are lifting the content from. At least a bibliography at the end of the book. The second part to this is copyleft/share-alike policy. To quote,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;If you make modifications or additions to the page you re-use, you must  license them under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License  3.0 or later. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Hence, Techmax is also violating this by copyrighting the content under their own restricting license. They should consider revising their license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, as far as the students are concerned, why not just take a little more effort and learn from the web instead of a printed version of the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edit&lt;/b&gt;. A little proof of what I am talking about. The content in the image in copyrighted by *cough* Techmax *cough* and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tAoGrWHiLtw/VXvfcCbT5sI/AAAAAAAAH-M/-cAT2Hu4gtg/s1600/20150613_120230.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tAoGrWHiLtw/VXvfcCbT5sI/AAAAAAAAH-M/-cAT2Hu4gtg/s640/20150613_120230.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://erp.techmaxbooks.com/PublisherBookList/BookDetails.aspx?kayMkNnwpPya//Mnxx+KW2tpeIIYHMDUJ1VBQqCfT3k=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Techmax&lt;/a&gt;, page8-23&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VGkbwax-UrE/VXvfy9faRRI/AAAAAAAAH-U/2eAmhQW4cHw/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2BSaturday%2B13%2BJune%2B2015%2B-%2B12%253A00%253A48%2B%2BIST.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VGkbwax-UrE/VXvfy9faRRI/AAAAAAAAH-U/2eAmhQW4cHw/s640/Screenshot%2B-%2BSaturday%2B13%2BJune%2B2015%2B-%2B12%253A00%253A48%2B%2BIST.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;As I said, this is just an instance.

                <title>A Day Of Struggle With Python IDEs</title>
                <description>Yesterday, I gave up on doing my next web application project with QT. I knew C++ was never meant to be a language of the web, but I really had some hopes with QT. It actually is good, and apparently it would have ran faster than any other platform or language for the web. The problem is, it is a lot time consuming to develop anything in it, especially web apps. I really don&#39;t have all that time. So I decided to do it in Python or Ruby. After reading some articles, it became clear, they are not much different, where python is a more general programming language, ruby is more towards the web, with it&#39;s rails framework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose Python, just because I know how to write code in python, beforehand. It was time to go shopping for some good frameworks to develop this thing. No doubt, finally I had to decide between &lt;a href=&quot;https://wakatime.com/django-vs-flask-worksheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Django and Flask&lt;/a&gt;. I choose flask. It was damn too simple, or at least it seemed like that. I tried the simple hello.py script which displays &lt;i&gt;&quot;hello world&quot;&lt;/i&gt; on the localhost port 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried that in emacs, but immediately felt the need for an IDE in this foreign land. I looked in my &#39;Downloads&#39; folder, and luckily there was Aptana Studio 3 still sitting there. I used to have it installed when I was into PHP last year. Since then, it got removed and thrown into a corner. I installed it. I really loved Aptana back then, for it&#39;s usability. But now, it started to act like a stubborn child, refusing to detect Flask. I googled and googled, but alas, no way. Many people seemed to be having the same problem, and the only solution I saw didn&#39;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing no way, I uninstalled Aptana, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81584/what-ide-to-use-for-python&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;googled for other good IDEs&lt;/a&gt;. PyCharm was what most were recommending. I decided to give it a try. Turned out, it was a memory hogger. Both my CPUs were doing a constant 100% and other windows turned sluggish too. About half a tonne of RAM was what it was utilizing, with a single .py file open with 4 lines of text in it. No way, again. Removed it, and went to eat some food. Damn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not ready to go to the sluggish Eclipse again, nor Netbeans for the same reason. Finally I settled for Komodo Edit, free lite version of the commercial Komodo IDE. It lacks many things that you will ask for in an IDE, and it is a little better than using bare emacs or vim. Still, for now, I am using it. Configured it to execute python script right inside the window following this tutorial, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21686395/how-to-run-the-first-python-program-in-komodo-edit-8-5&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21686395/how-to-run-the-first-python-program-in-komodo-edit-8-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life&#39;s good, but just hoping to learn flask for my next project as fast as I can.</description>

                <title>Grammar Nazi</title>
                <description>Let&#39;s start with a story. I go for workout in a nearby gymnasium. A few days back, I remember, it was a hot day, and we were all sweating, in spite of the air conditioner running continuously. One of my mates then, asked the gym trainer to increase the cooling of the AC. The trainer replied with &quot;It is already on 18&quot;. He then asked the trainer to make it 21 or 24 so that the cooling might increase. Hearing this, we all had a burst of laugh, since the guy thought increasing the number on the display would increase the cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now think about it this way. Many of you reading this might have an air conditioner at home, so you might know what this number on the display of the indoor unit means. It means degree Celsius, a unit of temperature. Even if you don&#39;t have an air conditioner, like me, you might have had the privilege of learning it in school or someplace else, that &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;°&lt;i&gt;C &lt;/i&gt;means degree Celsius. Now what if somebody never got a chance to know this? Neither was he privileged enough to have a closer look at an air conditioner at home or workplace, nor did he get a chance to study science. Would you make fun of him, for his ignorance? Or would you give him a word or two about his lack of knowledge and make him understand stuff? I am sure you would&#39;ve taught him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Now is the time, when people take pride in correcting other people&#39;s grammar when on the Internet. It is in vogue. Insulting somebody just because he or she speaks in broken English is cool. It immediately makes you look like a badass. It gives people an idea about your intellectual prowess. It clearly states that you had the privilege to attend a good English medium school and had the chance to read nice books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Think about someone who didn&#39;t get to attend a good school because of his or her personal problems. They never got to read good novels. From all the schooling they got, they are probably trying their best to speak good English. Yes, I agree some didn&#39;t take the efforts, but there are those who actually never got a chance. Life is hard. Not everyone is born privileged. You, me have no idea what the fuck people have been through. So before judging and making fun of people in public for their language, just to get that two second of fame of yours destroying somebody, remember, you can actually correct him or her politely and earn yourself a friend who looks up to you. Isn&#39;t that better?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Speaking with proper grammar is good. Without it is fine too. Language was meant to be a way to convey thoughts and emotions. Let&#39;s keep it that way. If you are understanding what a person is saying, even with broken grammar, why not pay more attention to what he or she says and less on being an arsehole. I am sure you&#39;ll have more friends that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

                <description>Salman Khan was awarded with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32603596&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;5 year jail term&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, on account of the 2002 hit and run case where he ran over 5 homeless people sleeping on the footpath, out of which, one died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the law will do it&#39;s job, justice will look at who&#39;s guilty and who&#39;s not, and there is nothing for a commoner like me, to add anything into it. But then, some people really don&#39;t understand these things. Here are some of the ridiculous things I read on the Internet lately, which I felt were a bit funny and low on intelligence, except that they actually were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I really lost words when I read this. She maybe be rich, and even very beautiful, but she&#39;s definitely not educated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;It&#39;s like penalising a train driver because someone decided to cross the tracks and got killed in the bargain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/salmankhancase?src=hash&quot;&gt;#salmankhancase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Farah Khan (@FarahKhanAli) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FarahKhanAli/status/595861607223205889&quot;&gt;May 6, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;No one should be sleeping on the road or footpath. It is dangerous to do that just like it is dangerous to cross tracks.&lt;/div&gt;— Farah Khan (@FarahKhanAli) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FarahKhanAli/status/595863980008144896&quot;&gt;May 6, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then maybe she got a blow to her head and came back to her senses. Or maybe not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;My ppl not sleeping on the road tweet is meant to mock the govt not d poor ppl Bec every govt is responsible to provide housing to its ppl&lt;/div&gt;— Farah Khan (@FarahKhanAli) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FarahKhanAli/status/595886953876234240&quot;&gt;May 6, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;For d record I never meant to mock d poor and if any of u read my tweets carefully I have not mocked the homeless.I blamed the govt not them&lt;/div&gt;— Farah Khan (@FarahKhanAli) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FarahKhanAli/status/596149921431965697&quot;&gt;May 7, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;And then there was this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Suicide is crime so is sleeping on footpath..80% homeles film ppl strugld achievd stardom but never slept on footpath &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BeingSalmanKhan&quot;&gt;@BeingSalmanKhan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— abhijeet  (@abhijeetsinger) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abhijeetsinger/status/595868019429019649&quot;&gt;May 6, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why not just call the case a suicide and let the convict free?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Come out fraternity, support &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BeingSalmanKhan&quot;&gt;@BeingSalmanKhan&lt;/a&gt; boldly not hypocriticly Roads footpath r not meant 4 sleeping, not driver&#39;s or alcohol&#39;s fault&lt;/div&gt;— abhijeet  (@abhijeetsinger) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abhijeetsinger/status/595860362194354176&quot;&gt;May 6, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And then the justification for DUI, driving under influence came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Etycdgrh5yQ/VUs222YAmjI/AAAAAAAAH74/0KDctx9JnVM/s1600/CEUK9F7VIAIkxco.jpg%3Alarge.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Etycdgrh5yQ/VUs222YAmjI/AAAAAAAAH74/0KDctx9JnVM/s1600/CEUK9F7VIAIkxco.jpg%3Alarge.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;This is real mature.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Mumbai ke road Aur footpath pe sone ka shauk hai ??

                <title>Debian 8 Jessie is here</title>
                <description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;next major stable release&lt;/a&gt; of the Debian lineup, the 8th one, codename Jessie was launched on 25th of april, last month. And like every Debian release, this one was packed with an awfully large package repo, meaning more free stuff to choose from, one of the fundamental reason I use Debian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total package base, with this release, is over 43,000, which is a lot. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/News/2015/20150426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;key features added&lt;/a&gt; to this release, make it one of the best Linux distros till date, imo. Not to mention, rock solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the major desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, XFCE, LXDE are supported (No Unity, sad ;), just select the preferred one during installation and it will download it for you. Alternatively, some iso are marked which desktop environment it ships, and if not specified explicitly, assume GNOME3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are already on Debian 7, to get Jessie, fully update the system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.&lt;/pre&gt;Then just head to /etc/apt/sources.list and replace every occurrence of &lt;i&gt;wheezy&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;jessie&lt;/i&gt; and then again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;That would be it. I noticed that Jessie is super fast, and I intentionally did a minimal install. The bootup and shutdown speeds are very impressive. Here is an amature video of me filming the shutdown time, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpOLUyRvkU8&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note, if you go to the downloads page, there are multiple DVDs, like for example, the amd64 complete comes in around 10 DVDs, but you only need the first one. It contains all the installation stuff and most of the packages you&#39;ll ever use, including the desktop environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downloads page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/CD/&quot;&gt;https://www.debian.org/CD/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip, you can add the DVD contents to your hard drive and set up an offline repository. Mount the contents of the DVD or copy it to a local folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;# in case of mounting the iso&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/abhishek/Debian/debian-8.0.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso /mount_point&lt;/pre&gt;Or just plain copy iso contents into the folder. Then add the following line on top of the /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;deb file:///mount_point/ jessie main contrib&lt;/pre&gt;so that it will check for a local copy of the package first for offline package installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was it for this promotional article [ ;) ] on Debian 8. Hope you like the new release and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you developers.</description>

                <title>I feel so powerless in my own country</title>
                <description>I am not feeling very good writing on such a topic, but yes, I have really convinced myself, if I am not rich, I am nothing in this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a daily sight for me, how being rich makes all the difference there is, here. If something is bothering me, I don&#39;t go complaining about it, but instead, I wait for the same thing to bother some politician or hotshot, so that he will complain and get it fixed, because even if I do complain, no one is going to hear me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is funny how thousands of people get checked at the airport everyday and no one bats an eye but when a famous celebrity goes through the same, our media loses its mind, criticizing the airport officials for doing their duty. How wealthy people demand changes and get them, and the others have to just adjust to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wonder, how politicians earn that much. I mean, they have fixed salaries when they are in power, and otherwise, they have to make a living doing something else. Instead, you&#39;ll find that every politician here has multiple houses in posh areas, farm houses, run their own colleges. Where does this lot of money come from? How come a guy, who has not worked a single hour, doesn&#39;t have a job nor any apparent legit business, roams around in a Jaguar, is respected by authority, is called upon as chief guest in functions and his orders are given more importance than the orders of law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a country where the people from military, police and the farmers are amongst the lowest earning people. They are overlooked most of the times, hardly make a living to keep their families fulfilled. On the other hand, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45hmgh/1-mahendra-singh-dhoni/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cricketers making billions of rupees&lt;/a&gt;, celebrities that are treated like deities and politicians and business people who get to take decisions on behalf of the entire nation. I have nothing against people who earn with their own efforts, but when some people keep all the money for themselves, it is the common people who suffer. And as money is synonymous to power and authority here in India, most of the people are robbed off their basic rights. Maybe I don&#39;t, but the people who sacrifice their lives for the nation deserve a better standard of living. When you see the kids of farmers not going to school because he can&#39;t even afford to feed them, let alone sending them to school, a part of you dies within. The guy who feeds the nation is unable to feed his own family, and the people who have put on the false mask of saving the culture and religion of this country, eat at international food joints and roam around in imported cars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, people don&#39;t help others to rise. Instead, when one is going down, he is pushed even harder. When people here find a source of income, they exploit it to the fullest, gathering as much as they can, until they can. See cricket for example. There is awful lot of money here. All other sports are ignored, only cricket. They give the excuse that cricket is a religion here, but the truth is, money is the religion here. Greed is, maybe, a human instinct. Here, people are not greedy, they are impaired by their brain, poor by their thoughts, disabled in terms of sensitivity. Check out the condition of sports that don&#39;t make money here. It is left to rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People in India are highly religious. They stand by their religion and people no matter what. The common people at least. This fact is well exploited by the politicians these days. Drag any argument into this dirt and hurt the sentiments of the weak hearted. Then follows the riots and jams, the damaging to the public property and what not. All this, just so that some people can get into the good books of the majority of the people who follow a religion and hope they help those some people to win elections. Pretty foolish, you might say. No, it really works. Welcome to India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You visit a temple. First thing you notice is two separate queues, one for the commoners and the other for the VIPs. The commoners line can get really long at occasions, sometimes 4-5 hours in queue. The VIP line hardly reaches any long, most of the times 10 minutes tops. Now some &lt;i&gt;wise &lt;/i&gt;folks argue that at the end both get to see the same God. Yeah, good luck convincing yourself that. This is just an example of what happens everyday, at everyplace in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know what bullies look like in India? No, they are not the fat ugly huge guys, but rather they are the ones who are friends with local politicians, who can get a gang standing by them on a mere call, who will beat you up along with half dozen of his friends even if you were right, and then even if you die, proving that he was the culprit in India will probably take the next 20 years in court who by then will have settled in some damn foreign country where our jurisdiction doesn&#39;t apply. This is what will happen. &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Warren-Anderson-CEO-of-Union-Carbide-during-the-1984-Bhopal-gas-tragedy-dies/articleshow/44992106.cms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This is what has been happening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you see the pattern. You can get off with any crime here in India. If you are a celebrity, you can walk in and out of the jail during your term, just like you do in a park, with obvious BS excuses. You can do whatever the hell you want to in this country, provided that you are rich.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I am not. Now you know why I feel so powerless in my own country.</description>

                <title>Net Neutrality</title>
                <description>Do you know, here in India, at most of the public places like temples, we have two separate queues. One for the ordinary folks, and the other one for the rich folks. Sometimes the rich folks are charged, sometimes they are just judged from the car they get down from and are treated likewise. On the other hand, the ordinary people are treated like cattles, pulled and pushed by the authority, because we are not really benefiting them much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the reason I would almost always choose Internet over any other public institution, at least in India. I know that whatever my social status be, on the Internet, I am equal. I have just as much right to put forth by thoughts as any rich businessman or a politician. I know that I have got people behind me who would not tolerate anyone who curtails my rights on the Internet. Yes, Internet is my home, and I am Internet&#39;s child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like always, there are people who cannot stand that the ordinary are getting this extra power. They want to bring all of this under control. They want to turn the Internet into their own playground where they will control the lines as in our temples, giving early and quick access to the one who pays extra and slow to the one who does not. They want to make sure only the ones who can pay get heard, and all the others are suppressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Net Neutrality&lt;/h3&gt;You are out with your family, on a nice sunday picnic when on a toll booth, you are told that your Maruti car is no longer allowed on this flyover because Hyundai has paid the construction company to only allow their cars through the shortcut. What would be your reaction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lAAz-YJyr2k/VSt8xLCNxNI/AAAAAAAAH7g/wHM831EryY8/s1600/Black-Girl-Wat.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; width=&quot;306&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;This, precisely! &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; (&#39;Inventor&#39; or the world wide web, or more technically, original implementer of the HTTP protocol) defines &#39;Net Neutrality&#39; as the principle that each packet of data should be treated equally, and no discrimination should be made based on economic motivations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exact opposite is what some telecom companies in India are trying to do. It started with Airtel. All of a sudden, it struck Airtel that if websites and applications can make revenue by creating services like messaging (like Whatsapp and Facebook) and calling (like Skype and Viber) which in turn decrease the usage of Airtel&#39;s own services of SMS and calling, it is their right to start charging these Internet services separately. They even got out with their VOIP pack that a customer had to subscribe in addition to the existing &#39;base&#39; data pack, to use this service. &lt;a href=&quot;http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/12/29/bharti-airtel-rates-idINKBN0K70A920141229&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eventually it was dropped&lt;/a&gt; on account of the resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this time, telecom companies have convinced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trai.gov.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TRAI&lt;/a&gt; that they must be entitled with the authority to intercept the traffic, to decide what websites to let users access, and what not, and if yes, then at what speed. Ridiculous, right? Charging more for extra speed can be justified, but why on earth are those innocent data packets discriminated. TRAI has even released a consultation paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/ConDis/10743_0.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asking 20 questions here&lt;/a&gt;. If you take a look, you would immediately see that the paper is made extra complicated to not make sense to you, yes you, the customer. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;C++ standard&lt;/a&gt; looks simpler. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what does it change for you, for me?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a customer&lt;/i&gt;, it will change almost everything for us that has any connection with the Internet. Firstly, we will have to pay for the usual data plan we currently do. So far so good. Now, you can&#39;t use any messenger services from this pack, so no Whatsapp, Facebook, WeChat and all. Similarly, no Internet calling services would work, like Skype and Viber. Well, they would work if you pay an extra Rs100 or so a month for the &#39;Special-messenger-pack&#39; and the &#39;Special-VOIP-pack&#39;. Now who the heck are these telecom companies to tell me how and what sites and services should I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it also gives the companies the power to control the speed of your connection on particular sites. For example, maybe Flipkart.com will load up instantly, but Amazon.in would take forever to load up just because Flipkart is affiliated with your service provider, and you are forced to buy from Flipkart. Disgusting, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#39;t want to pay Rs250 for data, Rs50 for Whatsapp, Rs70 for Facebook and Rs80 for Youtube seperately, then you should instantly head to&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savetheinternet.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.savetheinternet.in/ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and send an email to TRAI, which can be done with 2 clicks, yes literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a publisher&lt;/i&gt;, you might own a startup or maybe a modest blog like the one you are reading this article on. Now, large sites and enterprises with deep pockets can just call up these telecom companies and be like &quot;Make my site free on your network, I&#39;ll pay you the incentive.&quot; This will make all the traffic go on that particular site or use that particular service and not yours, which was equally good, or maybe better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internet is the only place guys, where everyone is still equal. We need to keep it this way, otherwise, we would be helpless. We know exactly how strong our law is, and how well behaved our politicians are. We know exactly how seriously we are taken by the mainstream media and the police. We, Indians, are like puppets for the rich filthy and greedy companies that rule here. And now, they are trying to close the only open source of information for us. Don&#39;t let that happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A humble request to all my fellow netizens. Log on to the site and send an email to TRAI. Educate your fellow netizens. Together we can stop this.&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savetheinternet.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.savetheinternet.in/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;For further reading, here is a short list.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netneutrality.in/&quot;&gt;http://www.netneutrality.in/&lt;/a&gt; - More information and compilation of articles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/netneutralityin&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/netneutralityin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neutrality_in&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/neutrality_in&lt;/a&gt; - Social handles to follow for latest updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome video by All India Bakchod to put it simply - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfY1NKrzqi0&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfY1NKrzqi0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/31lyxx/table_of_companies_which_support_net_neutrality/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;List of violators and supporters of net neutrality,&lt;/a&gt; so the next time you have to choose between them, you know whose side to take and whose product to use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@chupchap/india-s-net-neutrality-debate-explained-in-memes-3a8f6febaccf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Post on Medium by NT Balanarayan&lt;/a&gt; explaining the intensity of this situation with memes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReaddata/ConsultationPaper/Document/OTT-CP-27032015.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TRAI Consultation paper&lt;/a&gt; hot-link (PDF)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/telecom-regulatory-authority-of-india-call-to-protect-net-neutrality-in-india-and-block-airtel-other-telecoms-from-who-are-trying-to-break-it-for-personal-gains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Petition on Change.org&lt;/a&gt; - You should help here as well.

                <title>What programming isn&#39;t</title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There were days when I used to search the web for &#39;&lt;i&gt;best programming languages&lt;/i&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;i&gt;most popular programming languages&lt;/i&gt;&#39; in my free time. I was not able to decide myself what language to learn and invest my time upon, such that it would pay me back everything I put into it. This was really a hard task, given the fact that I have interest in a wide range of stuff related to computers, from algorithms to designing beautiful forms with CSS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Given that I had no guidance from the people around me, since I had no one in my family from the technical field, and the college professors were not of much help either. Now that justifies my amateur-ish googling habits.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Leaving that aside, I have lately been asked a lot of times by my fellow mates, what is the &#39;&lt;i&gt;best language&lt;/i&gt;&#39; to start with and what are the current &#39;&lt;i&gt;hot languages&lt;/i&gt;&#39; in the market. To start with, there is no language that is &#39;best&#39; in every sense. If there was, why would anyone bother creating additional languages in the first place, right? Languages are written and implemented with certain goals in mind, which it should satisfies better than what was present before creating that language, that&#39;s the whole point about it. So stop searching for the best language and start looking for your own needs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Secondly, I don&#39;t think anybody should care about the &#39;hot languages&#39; in the market, except for the tech magazines&#39; journalists. Why? Because if you haven&#39;t heard of it yet, then you probably don&#39;t actually need it yet. It is much better to know a single language as a whole, than to learn 5 languages just for the sake of them being &#39;hot&#39;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you are new to programming, then most probably you are taught programming using some or the other language (most probably C++ or Python). What most fail to teach is that programming is not equal to learning a language. Programming is the mindset that you develop when you are solving problem for a wide range of sub-problems by writing a common solution to all. Most of the times it means looking for a pattern in the chaos of that problem. You don&#39;t need to know a language for finding this pattern, do you? You have to realize this thing at the earliest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Programming language that you choose is the tool you choose for the task you have in hand. Now, depending upon the task, some tool might be better than the others, and help you in doing the task quicker. You can think of an analogy here, like if you want to cut tree trunks, you can use saw blade or maybe even a kitchen knife. But the saw will get the job done much faster. However, any sane human won&#39;t cut vegetables using a saw. The same goes for programming languages. Different tasks demand different languages, and each has its own pros and cons. But the languages won&#39;t help a bit if you cannot figure out the problem itself in the first place.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I had start to program in C, jumped to Python because &#39;Google used it&#39;. Then I came to PHP because I read somewhere that PHP gets you a job quickly. I started with JS and Node.js later due to their growing popularity. I did a lot of mistakes when I started it all. I wish I knew it then, that instead of wasting my time on learning the syntax of languages to do the exact same thing I did with the previous language, I could have been much better off learning some interesting algorithms that would&#39;ve helped me in solving some tough hackathon problems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So is the knowledge of language implementations not useful? Of course, I don&#39;t mean that. A language is very useful once you know how to use it. You don&#39;t have to know everything from a language. Just enough to get the problem solved. Nothing more. For example, you might have probably heard of C++. If you have ever tried to learn C++, you might have realized that it is a really large language. Originally designed for low level embedded programming and as a &#39;C with Classes&#39;, C++ has evolved to be a language that can be used in almost every domain. The &#39;Standard Template Library&#39; is large enough for you to not miss anything in most of the cases, and even if you do, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boost.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;boost&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at your rescue. So do you think you most know all of the above to call yourself a C++ programmer? No. Many great programmers who use this language use just a subset of it and they are fine with it. I personally don&#39;t use the object oriented facilities of the language much, but it doesn&#39;t matter as long as it does what you want it to do. So don&#39;t aim to know an entire language unless you want to get into compiler development or it&#39;s standardization committee. Focus on the thing you are working on, and not the language you are using.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Have the enthusiasm to solve problems. Take pride in building things from the scratch, all by yourself. The love for programming comes in automatically. But most important of all, learn how to program and not how to write syntax of a particular language.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <title>Engineering</title>
                <description>&lt;i&gt;Engineer&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;What comes to your mind when you hear that word? To me, the picture of a hard working individual, who is rational in his way of life, sees every aspect with the touch of technicality, given a job, he will do whatever it takes to get it done, selfless about his own personal pleasures, solving the problems of this world, one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least that is what comes to my mind. The reality is far from it. We have more &lt;a href=&quot;http://dazeinfo.com/2014/10/28/1-5-million-engineering-pass-outs-india-every-year-fewer-getting-hired-trends/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;engineering colleges&lt;/a&gt; here in India than we have good hospitals. Why? Because you cannot charge Rs.400k from each patient that visits your hospital the way you can from the students that study engineering course. In the particular state that I live in, engineering colleges are a part time income source of the politicians here. See the problem in India is, everybody wants to get rich, before the other one. Now there is nothing wrong with it as long as you don&#39;t steal people from their rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A student, passed out from junior college, is an empty vase eager to absorb knowledge. He is excited about his life ahead, his life in a professional institute where he will be taught the essentials to work in the industry for most of his life later. He has dreams, just like everyone. He has interests, and he tries very hard to get the stream of his choice. He had been working hard since the very day he got admitted in school for this particular moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the moment of truth arrives. He is admitted into a good college. He even gets the stream of his choice. There is no bounds to his happiness. His life is all set to rock, in a sense. Isn&#39;t it? His parents pay their hard earned money to the college, thinking that it will benefit their child to become a better man, an &#39;educated&#39; person, a responsible citizen. Now the student&#39;s joy know no bounds. He is excited as a child is on his first visit to an amusement park. The can&#39;t sleep the day before his first day at college. Its time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day of college, he wakes up early. Gets ready and dashes his way to the college. He has 4-5 blank books in his bag, to make notes on what the professor teaches. He trips on the way multiple times due to excitement. On reaching the college, he takes the first bench in the class. &quot;I would be able to pay more attention from here&quot;, he whispers. The professor enters the classroom with a set of papers and a fat reference book. He speaks out his name, rather lifelessly, and gives a very brief intro on the topic he would be teaching that semester. The intro was rather too short.&quot;This is it? Why doesn&#39;t he speak more on it.&quot; whispers the student. He was enjoying it. But the professor must hurry, a vast syllabus is waiting to get done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the day goes similar. Nothing out of the ordinary. Nobody wants to talk anything out of the textbook. Probably it will waste a lot of time of the professor. Days pass by, and the only thing that changes is the number of books in the student&#39;s bag. From 6 to 3 and then to one common rough book for all subjects. No, not because he was lazy to carry them all, but the pathetic quality of notes his teachers gave, he simply didn&#39;t feel like they are worth of writing in separate books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few boring days with no activity, which he later realizes were the best days of the semester, the professor starts to give them assignments as homework. Not the kind of assignments where you can research and write on your own, but the &lt;i&gt;do-it-by-tomorrow-atleast-30-pages-or-get-a-C-grade &lt;/i&gt;kind of assignments. Alas, there isn&#39;t enough time to find the solutions. He gets readymade solutions from a friend who had copied it from another friend who might have got the solutions from previous year&#39;s journal of a senior, and copies all the answers into his assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing in practicals too. Most of the time he is made to write journals so that he might submit them on time. So basically practicals are library hours where he gets to do nothing &#39;practical&#39; but copy from other&#39;s journals so that at least he can get an A grade, which eventually by the end of the semester gets him 5 additional marks, at the cost of wasting the precious practical hours where he could have maybe learnt how that particular IC works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days fly by quickly. Sitting for lectures where you don&#39;t understand a word of what the professor says, but still have to, for attendance. Yes, the university enforces 75% compulsory attendance but fails to enforce benchmarks for the quality of lectures the professors give. Maybe enforcing the later will automatically make the attendance, not only 75% but also 90%, of most students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failing to comply with the attendance policy of the college results the student not being able to attend his exams and parents getting called up to meet the professors in college. What happens when a professor comes to teach a topic he has hardly any idea of, gives the worst lecture you can possibly imagine with all bits of information flying around, and then leaves? Nothing happens. Even if you do complain about it, the replacement is as good as the old one, so most of the student don&#39;t even bother to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technical festivals. Yes, the thing our colleges are famous for. Technical festival, or tech fest as we call them, are something I personally waited for the entire semester. I could imagine all the amazing stuff that would be put to display, the workshops, the seminars and the enthusiasm. When it came, it was nothing as I had in my mind. It was all guys and girls hanging out enjoying their accidental holiday. It was foolish games like laser tag, devil_maze where people were made to run through dark corridors created with black curtains and UV lights. It was nothing technical, only games-which-can-attract-most-participants-and-earn-most-ticket-fees festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concludes with the semester exams, or finals. Here all we learn is the questioning pattern of the university so that we can quite accurately guess what is going to be there on the exam the next day and how am I going to fool the paper checker into believing that I know something about the topic, not much but something to earn me passing marks, after which I will spend 15 days doing nothing but hoping the next semester is better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a student has covered 1/8th of his life in the engineering course, spending a fortune as time and money, achieving nothing, and now the only thing differs is that he knows how the rest 7/8ths of this life of his, which he highly anticipated, are going to be like. Welcome to the reality.</description>

                <title>AIB Knockout</title>
                <description>If you happen to be from India, you must have most probably heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Bakchod_Knockout&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AIB Knockout&lt;/a&gt; thing, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_%28comedy%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roast&lt;/a&gt; (an event in which a celebrity is subject to insults and rest of the audience is well, entertained by it.) hosted by Karan Johar in Mumbai. It was uploaded on youtube in late jan, and removed in around 5-6 days due to controversies brewing, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/AIB-Knockout-FIR-lodged-against-Ranveer-Karan-Arjun-Deepika-Sonakshi-and-11-others/articleshow/46140025.cms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FIR lodged against the host&lt;/a&gt; and some other members for &#39;filthy language&#39; and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, things like that happen. For some it was entertainment and business, while for others, a quick shot to get some attention. Whatever the reason is, the question was, is it right to host such events here in India, and also was it right to force the content&#39;s removal from youtube?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know. I did watch that video (for about the first 10 minutes), and it WAS filthy, but was it the only thing filthy on the Indian media or around here? Of course not. We have &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Two-Karnataka-ministers-caught-watching-porn-film-in-assembly/articleshow/11794727.cms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;politicians watching porn in the assembly&lt;/a&gt;, waving money to &#39;buy&#39; seats (and these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cash-for-vote-scam-amar-singh-three-bjp-leaders-who-waved-cash-in-parliament-let-off-542036&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;politicians are now roaming free&lt;/a&gt;, by the way) and well, all porn sites work fine here, no bans on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do I advocate more such roasts? No. Am I happy with it getting off youtube? No, again. So what is the reason of this boring post?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, see. I don&#39;t mind such things on the media because much filthier things already exist, and we don&#39;t seem to give a damn. Although things like this roast bore me, I do advocate freedom of expression. What I care about much more is the influence it has on our youth. The problem with Indian youth is that they crave for westernization. After watching that roast, many of my friends, including the ladies, started to feel an amazing pride in prefixing any adjective they used, with &#39;fucking&#39;. Why? I don&#39;t know. Maybe to sound bad ass, or retarded, whatever. Swearing isn&#39;t bad, and we do it to express strong emotions, but doing it just for the sake of looking cool is bullshit with warm urine. You seriously don&#39;t want to sound like that, do you? Also, these celebrities happen to get paid for their popularity, which increases with such shit talks. Unless you are in a similar field where your popularity gets you pay cheques, you should seriously avoid following them, at least in the way they talk and dress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, watch everything, even porn. Doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is how much you let it influence you. You can&#39;t ban the internet. Off youtube and it shows up on multiple torrent and file uploading sites. You just cannot hide information. The most you can do is educate the people.</description>

                <title>Time</title>
                <description>Time is one of my favorite subjects. The reason being it&#39;s highly mysterious and absolute nature. It give everything a reference frame. How else on earth would have you said when a thing actually occurred. It actually gives even the rest of the three dimensions a reference frame. Newton put forth the theory that nothing in the Universe is absolutely stationary, no not you standing still, because the earth is spinning, and not the earth since it is revolving around the sun. The sun goes round the Milky Way (our home galaxy) once in every &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;225 million years&lt;/a&gt;. Not surprising now, the Milky Way is not stationary itself, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moving towards Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; (our neighboring galaxy) at about 400,000 km/h. Point here is that, you cannot determine the absolute position of an object anywhere in the Universe by just giving the three physical dimensions. It simple doesn&#39;t work where there is no frame of reference. Then how do you tell your position? You tell it in terms of space-time. The fourth dimension, that is of the time can be in any unit of time. We can actually convert the first three coordinates&amp;nbsp; in terms of light-seconds which is distance in terms of time taken by the light to travel the same distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But well, time is in fact, only absolute to a person at a particular position. Time is well &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/8940/how-can-gravitational-forces-influence-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;affected by gravity&lt;/a&gt;, the same way light is. This is to simply say the time seems somewhat slower near a body of high mass, like the earth, or a black hole for some serious observations. We don&#39;t actually see these differences in our routine life since they are too small in case of the Earth (Earth is not as dense as it should be for practical effects of delay in time to be observed by us). But there are applications on Earth that require precise measurement of time, and one such application is the Global Positioning System, the GPS in almost every phone these days. It relies on three geostationary satellites that measure the exact time taken for the receiver to reach them, creating a triangular plot, estimating the position of the receiver on the surface on the planet within a couple of meters accurately. These satellites are feed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Special_and_general_relativity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;slightly wrong time&lt;/a&gt; after some unspecified interval, just so that it can adjust with the &#39;slower&#39; time on the Earth&#39;s surface (on account of the larger mass of Earth affecting the bodies near to it to a larger extent and also due to the relatively faster time on these satellites on account of their speeds due to special relativity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another interesting thing to note here. How can you say if you are experiencing a slower version of time than you did some time in the past? You can&#39;t. The reason is, &#39;slower&#39; and &#39;faster&#39; time are for the observers that are experiencing a relatively &#39;faster&#39; or &#39;slower&#39; time. So it is all relative. Talking about time in the context of speed of light, we come to an amazing theory by Einstein. Einstein proposed that the speed at which light travels is absolute and does not depend on the relative speed and position of the observer. To put it simply, imagine you are traveling on a highway at 60km/h. Another vehicle traveling at 70 overtakes you. For you, the relative speed of the other vehicle is 10km/h (which is, 70-60=10). This is how we expect things to behave right? Of course. But things change as one approaches the speed of light. See that light doesn&#39;t behave the same way our highway example cars did. However fast you&#39;re traveling, light will still be 300,000km/s faster than you, even if you are actually doing 290,000km/s (which is just about impossible for a body of large mass like us, but certain elementary particles can achieve those speeds). This can be considered the universal speed limits. So what happens when some particle tries to break this barrier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For understanding this, let us consider the cone of light. When a particular event occurs, it sends out light (or radiations) in all possible directions. This is like throwing a pebble in a pond of water. It spreads in all possible directions and it&#39;s size increases every instant. The outermost wave is the wave initially created by the pebble itself. Now think of this as light. An event occurs and light from that event spreads in all possible direction. Considering time on y axis and space on x, we can imagine a cone getting created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mZiPPW6N7g/VM5QfToCGSI/AAAAAAAAHwc/8dHN0Jt5A_s/s1600/World_line.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mZiPPW6N7g/VM5QfToCGSI/AAAAAAAAHwc/8dHN0Jt5A_s/s1600/World_line.png&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/World_line.png&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when something occurs, you don&#39;t see it immediately, until the light from that event hits your retina. Consider the sun, for example. It is at a distance of about 149 million kilometers from the earth. Light takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel this distance. This is the reason the sunlight you&#39;re seeing now is about 8 minutes and 20 seconds old. Which means that it takes the cone of light from sun, 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach us, and make us aware of it. Still, considering the distances of other planetary objects, sun is quite close to us. Our nearest star, Alpha Centauri is at a distance of 4.3 light years from us, that is, the cone of light takes 4.3 years from Alpha Centauri to reach us. Since it is the cone of light, not surprisingly, it travels outwards at the speed of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to our original question, what if some particle tries to break the barrier of speed of light? If that happens, it will move from inside the cone of light of one event to outside of it, effectively seeing the time from the past, hence &#39;traveling in the past&#39;. But is that possible? No, according to the special theory of relativity. Since speed of light is absolute to the reference frame it is measured in, nothing can reach it (the mass of an object goes on increasing with increasing velocity. Close to the speed of light, the mass of the object is infinity and pushing an object of mass infinity is not possible). This was even proved by an experiment (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michelson-Morley&lt;/a&gt; experiment). This theory was consistent with the observations and most other theories, but Newton&#39;s gravitation theory. If everything travels at speeds less than or equal to the speed of light, how do we explain the effects of gravitation on distant planets and stars instantaneously. Does &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gravity travel at infinite speeds&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to relativity, which states that gravity travels at speed of light, which is again, not in accordance with solar system observations? Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Einstein spent a great deal of time trying to find a theory that would be consistent with both, the theory of relativity and the theory of gravitation. Finally he came up with something called the general theory of relativity. This theory suggested that the force of gravity doesn&#39;t act like normal forces but it acts on the &#39;space-time&#39; fabric, bending it in proportion with the relative energy and mass of the body. This suggested that the bodies revolving other bodies like the moon and earth are not traveling round the other body, but actually taking a straight path in the space time fabric which is 4 dimensional, and they only &#39;appear&#39; to travel in elliptical orbits as we see them in 3 dimensions. This was a revolutionary suggestion. It implied that time, light all traveled curved path near objects of high mass or energy. That did, infact explained why time appeared slow near the surface of earth and faster from space, and also, how are we able to see stars that are just behind the sun even if a straight path to them would not be possible for light to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as we look at where this article started, yes, I was all wrong. I knew there was nothing as absolute space, but as it turned out, there is nothing as absolute time as well. Interesting though, isn&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Time in the world of computers!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;Computers happen to be my most favorite subject after astrophysics, so how can I let this special opportunity go without playing around with time functions in C++. To be honest, I had been on this time thing from about 2 weeks. I needed to calculate time precisely for looking at the efficiency of sorting algorithms. Not surprisingly, computers are way too fast for calculating time in seconds or milliseconds. To see the difference in time taken by two algorithms for sorting a set of 50 random numbers, you need to measure time in nanoseconds, at the least microseconds. Although I had trouble (a lot of trouble, in fact) in getting the time functions to work for me, I finally succeeded in getting nanosecond level precision without any extra props, just my PC and g++ compiler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting from the first thought that came to my mind, get some C++ reference for built in functions. time() from &amp;lt;ctime&amp;gt; does a great job to fetch the number of seconds since 1st Jan, 1970, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/45da0ea982ab68adaa2c.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;but not good enough for me here. I knew that the bash command &#39;date&#39; can be used for my purpose, but I couldn&#39;t see a way to get the output of the command to my program back. I did some over smartness here. I executed the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;system(&quot;date +%s%N &amp;gt; text&quot;)&lt;/span&gt; which wrote the current timestamp upto the nanosecond to &#39;text&#39; file. Then copy that time by reading the file into an unsigned long long int (since it is 19 digits long). Then after the calculations, repeat it again and subtract the initial time from the final one. A bit long cut, but I hoped it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/1c9dbbf003b74a730a1e.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I ran this code, it took, surprisingly 18+ milliseconds, or in particular 18649390 nanoseconds. And to be clear, I haven&#39;t even included any code whose performance benchmarks I had to measure. This is the base time, LOL. Thinking about it for a second, algorithms store variables in cache, because RAM is not fast enough and I tried to write and read from the hard drive. That is so damn clever of me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pun aside, Now it was time to get help. Many stackoverflow posts and a good guy&#39;s guidance later, I finally got the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #674ea7;&quot;&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/span&gt; from &amp;lt;sys/time.h&amp;gt; to work. Yes, now I was getting some pretty good numbers and I could see the difference when I added more stuff to the code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/e7e41567d518c22b4f38.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Executing the raw code without any load gave some results I was hoping to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZfWwXFoJtc/VM5lOjVHmlI/AAAAAAAAHws/uN9sQyLAWug/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-02-01%2B23%3A09%3A47.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZfWwXFoJtc/VM5lOjVHmlI/AAAAAAAAHws/uN9sQyLAWug/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-02-01%2B23%3A09%3A47.png&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;210 nanoseconds which is fine for a code that does nothing. This will serve all of my purposes, and should do most of anyone&#39;s who is up with sorting algorithms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I tried hard to find good sources for information on the first part of this article, still if there is any mistake, don&#39;t hesitate to notify me. </description>

                <title>Handling large numbers with C/C++</title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;I will tell you what this is about. I saw a simple looking problem on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/small-factorials/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HackerEarth&lt;/a&gt; about finding factorial of given numbers. It looks easy, but another look at the constraints (1&amp;lt;=N&amp;lt;=100) changes everything. Well, not everything, especially if you are going to write it in languages like Python (&quot;dynamically typed&quot;) which has built-in capabilities to handle big numbers, but it is really a trouble to do it in C or any such statically typed language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first of all, what exactly is the difference between statically and dynamically typed languages. Dynamically typed languages require their interpreters to detect the type of the variable from the value that is assigned to it. On the other hand, in statically typed languages, the type of the variables must be known at compile time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some believe the latter has advantages over the former. As we explicitly state the type, run time errors are reduced and run time performance increases. We won&#39;t get into that discussion here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;So our problem&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before getting into it, I will first write the Python code that worked flawlessly and gave answers to factorials of over 100.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/a7a894bee916cf2910e2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;As you can see, it doesn&#39;t get any easier for anybody, no matter how novice he is with programming. But how does one solve the same problem with languages with no native support for big (of order &amp;gt;10^100) numbers? Simple. We make use of algorithms. The first thing that pops in one&#39;s mind when dealing with numbers this large is the use of arrays. Yes, that is the right way to go, or at least the one that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is the plan. We create an array of integers which will hold a digit in each index, starting with the least significant bit. For example, if we were to store the number 12345 in the array, we would do it like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 15px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 15px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;} .tg .tg-xueg{font-weight:bold;background-color:#ffffc7;color:#333333} .tg .tg-2ks1{font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background-color:#ffffc7;color:#333333} &lt;/style&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot;&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-xueg&quot;&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-xueg&quot;&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-xueg&quot;&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-xueg&quot;&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-2ks1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is,&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fff2cc;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;array[0]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stores &#39;5&#39;, &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;array[1]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stores &#39;4&#39; and so on. We have reversed the number for a specific reason. For knowing that reason, you have to go back to your 2nd grade class where you were taught to multiply two two-digit numbers. How did you do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:3px 11px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:3px 11px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;} .tg .tg-bsv2{background-color:#efefef} .tg .tg-cxkv{background-color:#ffffff} .tg .tg-c7d0{background-color:#bbdaff} .tg .tg-fqpo{background-color:#cbcefb} .tg .tg-8o5d{background-color:#34ff34} &lt;/style&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot; style=&quot;table-layout: fixed; width: 86px;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 21px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/col&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 21px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/col&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 22px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/col&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 22px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-bsv2&quot;&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-bsv2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-cxkv&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-c7d0&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-c7d0&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-cxkv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-c7d0&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-c7d0&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-fqpo&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-8o5d&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-8o5d&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-8o5d&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-8o5d&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got the memory back? Although it may seem a trivial thing now, notice that you never do a multiplication whose result is more than 81, that is, 9x9 which is the product of largest two single digit numbers. So can you somehow make the computer follow the same method to calculate the factorial, such that it never does a &amp;gt;81 digit addition in the entire process, which is well inside the size of the shortest numeric data type in C &lt;i&gt;(unsigned short: 65,535)&lt;/i&gt;? Yes, of course. We are coders, right? ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, we will need variables.&lt;br /&gt;We will use &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;num&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to accept the input number whose factorial is to be found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;cur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stores the result of the calculation&lt;i&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;i * arr[j] + temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. The least significant digit from &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;cur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (for example &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;, in case of &lt;i&gt;123&lt;/i&gt;) goes into &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;arr[j]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; while the remaining digits get stored in the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;temp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; variable. Follow the above step till the end of the array which we initially denote by &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/i&gt;variable. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;pos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is initialized and assigned 1, as we initialize our &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;arr[]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;arr[0]=1&lt;/span&gt; (since we will be using this value to multiply subsequent 2,3,4...&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;, we don&#39;t want our answer to evaluate to 0).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this loop, we will need to empty out the carry forward integer in our &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;temp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; variable. It will be done in the reverse order as well, but here, we will increment &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;pos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to make it always point to the number of digits in &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;arr[]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally you can print our the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;arr[]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the reverse order to get the expected answer and this should not surprise you since we have been doing storing of the numbers in reverse order in our &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;arr[]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Here is the C++ code that I wrote. I didn&#39;t cross check the results for larger values of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #d9d2e9;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;num&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so take care with that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/34824e2918e86fcf2576.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; So that was it for this short article. I am reading more on GMP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gmplib.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that is written exactly for this purpose. Nevertheless, it is always good to know how to do it by hand. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <title>What is GNU/Linux </title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;The following is a piece from my previous blog. I had written it in one of my diaries and since that blog of mine is no more, I would like to publish it here. My views on Linux/GNU and why it is one of the most amazing thing you will ever learn. Here it goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;What is Linux?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In the early 1990s, Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds began hacking on Minix, a small Unix-like operating system for PC then used in college OS courses. He decided to improve the main software component underlying Minix, called the kernel, by writing his own. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In late 1991, Torvalds published the first version of this kernel on the Internet and called it Linux, a mix of his own name and Minix.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;When Torvalds published Linux, he used the GNU&#39;s General Public License which made the software free to use, copy and modify by anyone provided that the copies and any variations are kept equally free. Torvalds also invited contributions from other programmers. Though these contributions came slowly at first, as Internet evolved, thousands of hackers and programmers from around the globe contributed to his free software project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Linux software developed so quickly that today, Linux is a complete modern OS, which can be used by programmers and non-programmers alike.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;What makes Linux so special?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The building blocks of Linux OS are the &#39;tools&#39;. If you ask for a rough definition, &#39;A tool is a small piece of code that is designed to perform one and only one task with great precision&#39;.That&#39;s it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The entire Linux concept is based on thiese little pieces of code. Most operating systems (like Microsoft Windows) have large utilities called applications. These applications can perform a large number of functions or tasks, for example word processors, presentation designers or a web browser. Along with their main tasks, this applications also perform some side tasks like search, replace, spelling checks often found in all applications. The source code for these applications is stored separately (or each binary has a separate set of these instructions) for each application, hence taking up more space on disk as well in memory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;These applications are often closed source, meaning it will do your job like magic, but you will never understand what is happening in the background (like what methods are implemented to search, can it be revised to make it more efficient and such). Hence programmers can never learn, use or build anything from it. The end result of this approach is that the same functions inside all these different applications must be built by programmers from scratch, separately and independently each time - a set back to the progress of the society as a whole and waste of countless man hours and energy that programmers use to code the same thing again and again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This is where Linux is special. Most of the tools (or all, for that matter) are open sourced, programmers can integrate them straight away without much effort to build something that takes the community as a whole ahead at a faster pace. Also, you don&#39;t have to spend any time debugging the tools most of the time because it is almost always that someone has used it in production before and rectified the bugs, as they are always there. Saves a lot of time for us, as developers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;There is also this interesting functionality called &#39;pipes&#39;. Pipes behave as one would expect from the name. It &#39;pipes&#39; the output of one tool to the input of another. If you didn&#39;t think about it already, you can create powerful tool chains that do multiple tasks in co-ordination giving the expected result, and using individual tools in sequence would have. Just as the tensile strength of steel is greater than the added strengths of its components nickel, cadmium and iron - multiple tools could be combined to some unpredictable results than that of the individual tools, called as the concept of &lt;i&gt;&#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;synergy&lt;/a&gt;&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, basic philosophy of all GNU/Linux tools.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;These basic tools which have been improved over these decades are crafted to do a particular task to perfection, and even if it doesn&#39;t fit your requirement, you can always grab the source, edit it accordingly and use it. If you want to keep up with the open source spirit, post it online so it will save some time of someone with the same problem. These small tools can be a power weapon in the hands of a Linux expert, or &lt;i&gt;Wizard&lt;/i&gt; as we call them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Note that when I use the term &#39;Linux, I mean GNU/Linux. The entire thing wouldn&#39;t be possible with either one. Linux is the kernel and rest of the OS is GNU.

                <title>Jumping over multiple programming languages</title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;I just happened to take a look at my own blog. Starting with some posts about python, I went to C, then PHP-MySQL and then Javascript. All of this in around 3 months. Now, it is great to know multiple languages, but the thing I feel is, you must &#39;know&#39; them. Knowing in the sense, the underlying philosophy, best practices and such. I have started with at least 10 languages this year. I can code little bits in all of them, namely C, Java, Python, PHP, Javascript and some other like database, HTML/CSS which are not-so-much-programming languages. Problem is, I cannot code fluently in any of the above listed languages. I just tend to get bored by doing a language after some time and then jump to something else. Something needs to be done, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I didn&#39;t notice this myself. Friends, with whom I hangout, told me that I needed to concentrate on one thing, until I master it, before moving to something else. I couldn&#39;t agree more, but also couldn&#39;t decide what needs to be done. So kept trying different things till I get something that would keep me distracted for long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with web development. I hate PHP, although I also tend to code in it the most because it is efficient for quick dirty works. Python happens to be one of my favorite languages, because of the neatness and power. But at the same time, coming from C, I don&#39;t feel the depth in other languages that I got in C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web programming is great for some quick compliments. LOL. Just after a week, I could write great pieces of code that would amaze everyone. But deep down somewhere, I didn&#39;t feel good about myself. Its like, choosing the easy path rather than the challenging one. So I thought again, about some other stream. Yes, software programming is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started with Java. I did learn all the basics and some intermediate stuff. Java is great, but still, I missed C. I needed something close to the OS. I needed a language that I could use to interact with my Arduino. I needed something like C. So why not C again, perfecting it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Yes, I felt, getting back to C seemed to be the best way to go.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Then, out of nowhere, I got to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup&quot;&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s lecture at IIT-Bombay. Although I never got to get into the actual seminar, his mere presence was enough to push me into C++. I read about it, and even watch some online videos about C++ and opinion from experts about it. Seemed perfect. The control and power of C, the flexibility of Java and the usability of (almost) Python.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been doing C++ for about 2 weeks. Not much really, basic syntax and stuff. Important thing is, I am enjoying it. I really hope I stick to it for some time now till I master it. I don&#39;t want to be an example of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;jack of all trades and master of none&lt;/blockquote&gt;Let&#39;s hope my next post here has some serious C++ in it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <title>AJAX registration form using jQuery</title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;I have created this simple registration form which makes user registration using asynchronous requests in the background, checking if a duplicate username or email exists, and presenting the user with status of registration on the same page without have to reload the page even once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple, but with some prerequisites for my particular example. They are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;MySQL database for saving registrations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP registration page for connecting to database&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some basic javascript knowledge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&amp;nbsp;So having set up the above stuff, we shall get started. If you don&#39;t want to code all yourself, use my code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abhn/turnouts/tree/master&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, create for yourself a nice form. It doesn&#39;t take much right? Just make sure you attach an &#39;id&#39; attribute to each input field for convenience later. Here is my version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/a737ff8f28f2259b11c2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you see, after the form I have left an empty div. It is for displaying the response we get from our ajax request. You can, of course, add nice styling to this div. Having our form set, we can concentrate on the jQuery part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with making sure our DOM is loaded with $(document).ready() function. Grab hold of the click event of the form submit button. Then we get the values in the username, email and password fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, we can have some basic checks to make sure form is filled up. We could have used the &lt;i&gt;required&lt;/i&gt; attribute to make sure all fields are filled, but that does not give us full control, so use Javascript or jQuery and display some custom messages. I clubbed them together in a single if.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/6e060043c13d3dbf03f2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Next, using the simple $.ajax() function, make a request and get the response code. My action page is register.php, and I have make simple error codes to detect what response the backend gave. Here are the codes, for some reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;// Code returns 101 for &quot;username already exists&quot;&lt;br /&gt;// Code returns 102 for &quot;email already exists&quot;&lt;br /&gt;// Code returns 104 for &quot;internal server error&quot;&lt;br /&gt;// Code returns 202 for &quot;user created successfully&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refer &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abhn/turnouts/blob/master/register.php&quot;&gt;register.php&lt;/a&gt; for complete code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the query succeeds, we capture the response in responseText variable. We can then do any response based manipulation we need for our specific needs. Just make sure to &lt;i&gt;return false&lt;/i&gt; at the end to prevent default submit behavior. Here is my final jQuery snippet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/abhn/18f450bb299214d0c68f.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the entire HTML code has nothing more, just the standard doctype and stuff. Here is what to expect, or similar. LOL I was trying some CSS so ignore all that ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fz6kduaRLyc/VKBFf0eMnQI/AAAAAAAAHvs/yfIxoTQws1I/s1600/form.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fz6kduaRLyc/VKBFf0eMnQI/AAAAAAAAHvs/yfIxoTQws1I/s1600/form.png&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Also, I wanted to tell you, I switched from the classy syntax highlighter to this new (for me!) gist. It is cool, only a little more effort. Loved it. If you own a blog and post code frequently, give it a try. Thank you for reading.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <title>On why PHP removed magic quotes - Nice explanation</title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I am a newbie in PHP, or at least not as good to call myself mature. Recently, PHP announced deprecation for magic_quotes in version 5.3 and complete removal in version 5.4. So there are official docs on why it was removed, but this is what I found written by a contributor and it was perfectly explained. Do check out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php&quot;&gt;http://php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Here goes the comment: --&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The very reason magic quotes are deprecated is that a one-size-fits-all approach to escaping/quoting is wrongheaded and downright dangerous.&amp;nbsp; Different types of content have different special chars and different ways of escaping them, and what works in one tends to have side effects elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; Any sample code, here or anywhere else, that pretends to work like magic quotes --or does a similar conversion for HTML, SQL, or anything else for that matter -- is similarly wrongheaded and similarly dangerous.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magic quotes are not for security.&amp;nbsp; They never have been.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a convenience thing -- they exist so a PHP noob can fumble along and eventually write some mysql queries that kinda work, without having to learn about escaping/quoting data properly.&amp;nbsp; They prevent a few accidental syntax errors, as is their job.&amp;nbsp; But they won&#39;t stop a malicious and semi-knowledgeable attacker from trashing the PHP noob&#39;s database.&amp;nbsp; And that poor noob may never even know how or why his database is now gone, because magic quotes (or his spiffy &quot;i&#39;m gonna escape everything&quot; function) gave him a false sense of security.&amp;nbsp; He never had to learn how to really handle untrusted input.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Data should be escaped where you need it escaped, and for the domain in which it will be used.&amp;nbsp; (mysql_real_escape_string -- NOT addslashes! -- for MySQL (and that&#39;s only unless you have a clue and use prepared statements), htmlentities or htmlspecialchars for HTML, etc.)&amp;nbsp; Anything else is doomed to failure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <title>Creating an autocomplete field | Setting up frontend | Part 2</title>
                <description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagekar.com/2014/12/creating-autocomplete-field-with-ajax.html&quot;&gt;first part of this article&lt;/a&gt;, we had set up the backend MySQL database. Now we can write the code necessary to get information from the server and convert it to a format we can parse, JSON in my case here. So lets begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Step 4 - Writing script to get data from MySQL database&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;As always, we can write it in any language we are comfortable with. PHP happens to be mine. The script is straight forward, accept the pincode via a GET request, &#39;pincode&#39; parameter. Query the database for its existence, add it to an array and using &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;json_encode()&lt;/a&gt; function in PHP, display the output. If value does not exist, it will return null, and it is not our concern here about what happens after that, as it will be taken care by the application using this API.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Code: retrieve.php&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;br /&gt; $pincode = $_GET[&#39;pincode&#39;];&lt;br /&gt; $conn = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;password&quot;);&lt;br /&gt; mysql_select_db(&quot;turnouts&quot;) or die();&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; $pincode = (string)mysql_real_escape_string($pincode);&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; $sql = &quot;SELECT taluka, district, state FROM pincode WHERE pincode = &#39;$pincode&#39;&quot;;&lt;br /&gt; $data = mysql_query($sql);&lt;br /&gt; if(!$data) {&lt;br /&gt;  die(mysql_error());&lt;br /&gt; }&lt;br /&gt; $row = mysql_fetch_row($data);&lt;br /&gt; $taluka = $row[0];&lt;br /&gt; $district = $row[1];&lt;br /&gt; $state = $row[2];&lt;br /&gt; $state = str_replace(&quot;\r\n&quot;, &quot;&quot;, $state);&lt;br /&gt; $taluka = strtolower($taluka);&lt;br /&gt; $district = strtolower($district);&lt;br /&gt; $state = strtolower($state);&lt;br /&gt; header(&#39;Content-type: application/json&#39;);&lt;br /&gt; $array = array(&#39;taluka&#39;=&amp;gt;$taluka, &#39;district&#39;=&amp;gt;$district, &#39;state&#39;=&amp;gt;$state);&lt;br /&gt; echo json_encode($array);&lt;br /&gt;?&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The URL will follow the pattern, /retrieve.php?pincode=000000 and return data. As an example, the following image,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9FzaGvkA4nk/VJU8QZCIc0I/AAAAAAAAHvM/uiSEJCWN2gA/s1600/json.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9FzaGvkA4nk/VJU8QZCIc0I/AAAAAAAAHvM/uiSEJCWN2gA/s1600/json.png&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have come successfully to this step, then bingo! We now have a working API.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Step 5 - Writing an AJAX form using jQuery&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;We will now write a simple form with 4 fields in HTML. Include jQuery in that page, and then write the script at the bottom which will query our API asynchronously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Code: pincodes.html&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Pincodes&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;script src=&quot;js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;form&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;label for=&quot;pincode&quot;&amp;gt;Pincode:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;pincode&quot; id=&quot;pincode&quot; required /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;label for=&quot;taluka&quot;&amp;gt;Taluka:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;taluka&quot; id=&quot;taluka&quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;label for=&quot;district&quot;&amp;gt;District: &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;district&quot; id=&quot;district&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;label for=&quot;state&quot;&amp;gt;State:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;state&quot; id=&quot;state&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;$(document).ready(function() {&lt;br /&gt; $(&#39;#pincode&#39;).keyup(function(e) {&lt;br /&gt;  var pincode = $(this).val();&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  if(pincode.length == 6 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $.isNumeric(pincode)) {&lt;br /&gt;   var req = &#39;retrive.php?pincode=&#39; + pincode;&lt;br /&gt;   $.getJSON(req, null, function(data) {&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript&quot;&gt;                 &lt;br /&gt;    $(&#39;#taluka&#39;).val(data.taluka);&lt;br /&gt;    $(&#39;#district&#39;).val(data.district);&lt;br /&gt;    $(&#39;#state&#39;).val(data.state);&lt;br /&gt;   });&lt;br /&gt;  };&lt;br /&gt; });&lt;br /&gt;});&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some explanation goes here.&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;.keyup()&lt;/i&gt; event fires when a key is pressed in that field. We could have use &lt;i&gt;onFocus()&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;onBlur()&lt;/i&gt; in javascript but that only fires when a field is focused or blurred, so this is much better. Since we have pincodes of length 6 digits here in India, to prevent script from querying for the first five digits, we have added a &lt;i&gt;if(pincode.length == 6) &lt;/i&gt;to our code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the even fires as soon as one enters the 6th digit and populates the remaining three fields with the data it retrieves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CwczhZADQbA/VJVAJLLBbwI/AAAAAAAAHvY/9ZHX-eim0_Y/s1600/form.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CwczhZADQbA/VJVAJLLBbwI/AAAAAAAAHvY/9ZHX-eim0_Y/s1600/form.png&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It is hard to show it in a still image, but having just entered the pin, rest of the fields get populated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Finally&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;So this was it. I hope you enjoyed it. Any corrections or suggesting, mail them to me or just comment down below. Thank you for reading.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
