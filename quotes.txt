Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
Your life is ending one minute at a time. If you were to die tomorrow, what would you do today?
It is never to late to become what you never were.
The revolution will come when hackers meet political activists...
The planet is not dying, it is being killed. And those killing it have names and addresses.
"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need." - Karl Marx
The future will only contain what we put into it now.
Commute, work, commute, sleep...
In a society that abolishes adventure, the only adventure is in abolishing society.
Run, comrade, the old world is behind you!
Nature created neither servants nor masters. I want neither to rule or be ruled.
By stopping our machines together we will demonstrate their weakness.
I take my desires for reality because I believe in the reality of my desires.
Practice wishful thinking.
Be realistic, demand the impossible.
Going through the motions kills the emotions
Constraints imposed on pleasure excite the pleasure of living without constraints
The economy is wounded - I hope it dies!
How sad to love money
No freedom for the enemies of freedom
To hell with boundaries
It is my job to corrupt young people with the contageous, infectious idea of individual freedom.

"All our knowledge merely helps us to die a more painful death than animals that know nothing" - Maurice Maeterlinck
Politicians are like diapers.  They both need changing regularly and for the same reason.

Happiness isn't something you experience; its something you remember.
An expert is a person who avoids small error as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy.
"It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education." -Albert Einstein
Information wants to be free.
The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.
When they discover the center of the universe, a lot of people will be disappointed to discover they are not it.
The world tolerates conceit from those who are successful, but not from anybody else.
We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we don't care for.
For God hates utterly The bray of bragging tongues.
The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none.
The less their ability, the more their conceit.
Great ability develops and reveals itself increasingly with every new assignment.
Natural ability without education has more often attained to glory and virtue than education without natural ability.
I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestioned ability of a man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.
"Of all the things Ive lost, I miss my mind the most." -Ozzy Osbourne
Nerds don't just happen to dress informally. They do it too consistently. Consciously or not, they dress informally as a prophylactic measure against stupidity.
They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.
Any transition serious enough to alter your definition of self will require not just small adjustments in your way of living and thinking but a full-on metamorphosis.
There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
Turbulence is life force. It is opportunity. Lets love turbulence and use it for change.

"Every system, no matter how secure and well-designed, will be broken by some idiot user." -James Gaskin
The marvel of all history is the patience with which men and women submit to burdens unnecessarily laid upon them by their governments.
Two hashes were walking down the street and one was a salted.
"Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example." - Mark Twain
If you give someone $20 and never see them again, it was probably worth it.
People are most vulnerable when they feel safe.
Never test the water with both feet.
If car technology had advanced as quickly as computer technology, a Dodge Viper would cost $3.99, get a million miles per gallon, and explode twice every year.
"Authority is an illusion."
When one has not had a good father, one must create one.
"One who annoys you, has conquered you - xenoix "

Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success. 
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. 
Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. 
Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.

Master Foo then said: “Which one will reach the other side of the river: The one who dreams of a raft, or the one that hitchhikes to the next bridge?”
Master Foo: “A broken mirror never reflects again; fallen flowers never go back to the old branches.”
Master Foo said: “A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge is like a man who, seeking light, hugs a candle so closely that he smothers it and burns his hand.”
Master Foo turned back to the neophyte. “The housecat may mock the tiger,” said the master, “but doing so will not make his purr into a roar.”

The person who says it can't be done shouldn't interrupt the person who's doing it.

Don’t do things just because everyone is doing them. It’s not worth anything if you finish reading the book just for the sake of telling everyone that you read it, like you have some kind of checklist. Take your time, chill, have fun.
