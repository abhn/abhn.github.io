Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
Your life is ending one minute at a time. If you were to die tomorrow, what would you do today?
It is never to late to become what you never were.
The revolution will come when hackers meet political activists...
The planet is not dying, it is being killed. And those killing it have names and addresses.
"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need." - Karl Marx
The future will only contain what we put into it now.
Commute, work, commute, sleep...
In a society that abolishes adventure, the only adventure is in abolishing society.
Run, comrade, the old world is behind you!
Nature created neither servants nor masters. I want neither to rule or be ruled.
By stopping our machines together we will demonstrate their weakness.
I take my desires for reality because I believe in the reality of my desires.
Practice wishful thinking.
Be realistic, demand the impossible.
Going through the motions kills the emotions
Constraints imposed on pleasure excite the pleasure of living without constraints
The economy is wounded - I hope it dies!
How sad to love money
No freedom for the enemies of freedom
To hell with boundaries
It is my job to corrupt young people with the contageous, infectious idea of individual freedom.

"All our knowledge merely helps us to die a more painful death than animals that know nothing" - Maurice Maeterlinck

Happiness isn't something you experience; its something you remember.
An expert is a person who avoids small error as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy.
"It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education." -Albert Einstein
Information wants to be free.
The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.
When they discover the center of the universe, a lot of people will be disappointed to discover they are not it.
The world tolerates conceit from those who are successful, but not from anybody else.
We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we don't care for.
For God hates utterly The bray of bragging tongues.
The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none.
The less their ability, the more their conceit.
Great ability develops and reveals itself increasingly with every new assignment.
Natural ability without education has more often attained to glory and virtue than education without natural ability.
I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestioned ability of a man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.
"Of all the things Ive lost, I miss my mind the most." -Ozzy Osbourne
Nerds don't just happen to dress informally. They do it too consistently. Consciously or not, they dress informally as a prophylactic measure against stupidity.
They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.
Any transition serious enough to alter your definition of self will require not just small adjustments in your way of living and thinking but a full-on metamorphosis.
There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
Turbulence is life force. It is opportunity. Lets love turbulence and use it for change.
"The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards." -Gene Spafford

Government is too big and too important to be left to the politicians.

"Every system, no matter how secure and well-designed, will be broken by some idiot user." -James Gaskin
The marvel of all history is the patience with which men and women submit to burdens unnecessarily laid upon them by their governments.
Two hashes were walking down the street and one was a salted.
"Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example." - Mark Twain
If you give someone $20 and never see them again, it was probably worth it.
People are most vulnerable when they feel safe.
Never test the water with both feet.
If car technology had advanced as quickly as computer technology, a Dodge Viper would cost $3.99, get a million miles per gallon, and explode twice every year.
"Authority is an illusion."
When one has not had a good father, one must create one.
"One who annoys you, has conquered you - xenoix "
[A]s we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously. ~ ben franklin

A man is but the product of his thoughts; what he thinks, he becomes.
The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. H. Jackson Brown, Jr.
Let us sacrifice our today so that our children can have a better tomorrow. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!
Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle; you can live as if everything is a miracle.
I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.
Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'
Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.

In the long run, all of us are dead.
You can educate a fool, but you cannot make him think.
A good man once told me to open up to different music, cause it opens you up to different worlds and people. Never stick to only one, but try out many. Every genre has different stories from different times. That story is a life lesson, a sign....you just got to stop and read the sign and keep on walking. - comment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YibGpBSPibI

“If you do not repeatedly profile your code for hot spots while tuning, you will be like a fisherman who casts his net in an empty lake,” said Master Foo.
Master Foo then said: “Which one will reach the other side of the river: The one who dreams of a raft, or the one that hitchhikes to the next bridge?”
Master Foo: “A broken mirror never reflects again; fallen flowers never go back to the old branches.”
Master Foo said: “A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge is like a man who, seeking light, hugs a candle so closely that he smothers it and burns his hand.”
Master Foo turned back to the neophyte. “The housecat may mock the tiger,” said the master, “but doing so will not make his purr into a roar.”

The person who says it can't be done shouldn't interrupt the person who's doing it.
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
Don’t do things just because everyone is doing them. It’s not worth anything if you finish reading the book just for the sake of telling everyone that you read it, like you have some kind of checklist. Take your time, chill, have fun.

Coding, for a counterexample, is "90 percent finished" for half of the total coding time. Debugging is "99 percent complete" most of the time. "Planning complete" is an event one can proclaim almost at will.
Of all the great programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java. And of all the great programmers I can think of who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.

Sanity is not statistical.
They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.
A proprietary software company harvests personal information from a centralized government database using unaudited technology in a jurisdiction without a proper privacy or data protection law, sounds perfect to me!
Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves.
He who does not move does not notice his chains.
A programmer who has never used a debugger to look at the inner workings of a program is like a seventeenth-century doctor who has never used a microscope.
It is not good to drive faster if you can't stay on the road.
Something that is untested is broken.
Strong winds make trees take deeper roots.
Don't confuse motion with progress
The easy way is also the right way

Life is a pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.
"jo dikhta hai vohi bikta hai"
Security isn't really sexy to most companies, so if it can be overlooked, it will be. Rotating token-based authentication isn't something most companies can put on a marketing brochure, so lots of product managers struggle to dedicate resources unless someone is pounding the table saying, "this shit is important."
None of us is as smart as all of us.
If you start a startup, don't design your product to please VCs or potential acquirers. Design your product to please the users. If you win the users, everything else will follow. And if you don't, no one will care how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.
Software is eating the world.
"I, a universe of atoms. An atom in the universe"
Growth mindset: Believing that you can get smarter with practice.
"Ships don't sink because of the water around them; ships sink because of the water that gets in them. Don't let what's happening around you get inside you and weigh you down."

A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in
For all your days prepare; And meet them ever alike; When you are the anvil, bear; When you are the hammer, strike.
All reasonable men adapt themselves to the world. Only few unreasonable ones persist in trying to adapt the world to themselves. All progress in the world depends on these unreasonable men and their innovative and often conformist actions.
There is no such thing as a best solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system. There can only be systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.
You are a pack rat for little facts, each of which may affect some decision years from now.

The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.
Telling your boss “the cat ate my source code” just won’t cut it.
The cross-pollination of ideas is important; try to apply the lessons you’ve learned to your current project.
The best way to prevent mistakes is to anticipate them.
Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it’s the only one you have.
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will
The limits of language are the limits of one’s world.
"I am not young enough to know everything."
If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges.
To live only for some unknown future is superficial. It is like climbing a mountain to reach the peak without experiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustain life, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is gained, and technologies are mastered. The importance of the peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides. So I went on towards the top, but always experiencing the sides. I had a long way to go but I was in no hurry. I went in little steps -- just one step after another -- but each step towards the top.

Saying 'what kind of an idiot doesn't know about the Yellowstone supervolcano' is so much more boring than telling someone about the Yellowstone supervolcano for the first time.
The art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.
You never know when the next person who starts just fixing a misspelling in the documentation ends up implementing the next great feature. But you stand a chance to find out if you smile and say thank you for whatever small contribution that gets the motivation flowing.
It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day — that’s the hard part. But it does get easier
If you continue catching the vase when it falls, everyone will continue thinking the shelf is sturdy.
Desire is a contract you make with yourself to ne unhappy until you get what you want
With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of, and not apart from, the rest of nature
If we’re doomed to toil away until we die, we may as well pretend to like it. Even on Mondays.
You can often view glimpses of ingeniousness not as inexplicable miracles, but as the residue of experience; and when you do, the idea of genius goes from being mesmerizing to instead being actively inspirational.
Pause and ponder.
I have read 347 questions that began, "Could this be a bug?" One was a bug. (in the platform/framework)
There's no greater thing than knowing nothing, because then there's so much left to learn!
Yes, learning can prepare you for a career, but you don't need to work in a field for its great lessons to enrich your life.
I believe in a future where the value of your work is not determined by the size of your paycheck but by the amount of happiness you spread and the amount of meaning you give. I believe in a future where the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job but for a life well lived. I believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve.
Beware the barrenness of a busy life. - Socrates
And deep down I suspect that my need for perfect is a kind of excuse to not go. A way of avoiding all the fear that comes with leaving. Fear that if it’s not perfect it won’t work. Fear that something will go wrong. Whatever. Something will go wrong anyway. And you know what? A lot of times it’s the things that go wrong that turn out to be the most fun. Maybe not at the time, but later. - https://luxagraf.net/jrnl/2016/07/change-ideas-the-worst
We're all tourists on this planet.
You are putting yourself on a slippery slope when you start believing that the outcome of your effort represents or embodies who you really are as a person - what your value as a person is
Nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.
Fixing stuff we broke and deleting stuff we wrote. - Sir Ed's productivity summary
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.

Resilience
Although the creation of a universe might be very unlikely, Tryon emphasized that no one has counted the failed attempts.
He makes an analogy with a very large clothing store: "If there is a large stock of clothing, you're not surprised to find a suit that fits."
"Huge parts of the world are still unexplored" "In terms of trilobites?" "No, in terms of everything"
Oh fuck, not another phylum
It is very easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advvantage of all the intoxicating existence we've been endowed with. But what's life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as ours -- arguably stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don't. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment's additional existence. Life, in short, just wants to be. But -- and here's an interesting point -- for the most part it doesn't want to be much.
To a firrrst approximation, as David Raup likes to say, all species are extinct.
...but you could have all bdelloid rotifer experts in the world to dinner and not have to borrow plates from the neighbors.
"And I suppose that's why you value someone who spends forty-two yeras studying a single species of plants, even if it doesn't produce anything terribly new?" "Precisely"
From an evolutionary point of view, sex is really just a reward mechanism to encourage us to pass on our genetic material.
It cannot be said too often: All life is one. That is, and I suspect will forever prove to be, the most profound true statement there is.
I've decided to stick with love. Hate is too much of a burden to bear.
Don't take refuge in the false security of consensus
Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others (often reworded as "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept").
