<p>
  We entered a new year couple of weeks ago. I was a bit occupied with stuff around the new year's time, but finally I can sit down and reflect upon how the last year went by for me. I'll try to follow the same format as last year by writing what was good, what wasn't, and my hopes for 2020. You can also check out <a href="/2018/12/2018-year-review.html">2019's year review article</a>.
</p>

<h3>In short</h3>
<p>
  The start of this year was very busy given that I would be in India only for a week before <a href="/2019/01/mumbai-to-berlin.html">setting out for Germany</a>. There were a lot of feelings within me, all mixed together like the flavours in <a href="https://youtu.be/_UIZ71cA1Xs?t=30">Bhel Puri</a>. It wasn't super comfortable knowing that I'm moving away from the comforts of home in a totally foreign country where I knew no one, and didn't speak the language. Integrating in Germany was actually easier than what I had expected, and I think I was super lucky to find a good set of people around me. There was a lot of <a href="/2019/06/berlin-flat-search-experience.html">moving around in the city</a>, travelling within Europe, meeting new people and making friends, trying all sorts of food and much more. 
</p>
<p>
  2019 was a busy year, but a very positive one in that. It was the year when I could understand a bit more about the kind of person I was, and the kind of people I like having around. I am genuinely thankful to all the people who touched my life this year. Following are a few highlights from the past year and TODOs for this one.
</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

    Became much more confident about the kind of person I am, and gained insights about how I react in certain situations, especially adverse ones.

<h3>Other Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>
  Since everyone is talking about us moving into a new decade, here are a few of my thoughts and reflections. 10 years ago I was in my 10th grade, preparing for that big SSC exam every adult had scared us students about. That was the last thing we had to work hard for before we soar high in the comforts of adulthood, we were told.
</p>
<p>
  Alas, like many things we're told as kids, that wasn't true. What was true, however, was that I stopped taking academics seriously from that point on. I remember learning how to 'hack' into Windows registry and change random config options to impress my friends in our computers lab. The list of embarrassing stuff I did back in the day is longer than I'm willing to admit publicly.
</p>
<p>
  Interestingly, 10 years ago at this stage I still wanted to pursue science and not computers as a career. Computers were kind of new, science was the long term interest. Fascinating how things turned out, and how they could have if I had gone along the other path. Could be an article for another day. This is it for now.
