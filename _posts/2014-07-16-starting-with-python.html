<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Ok so first let me make it clear, this is not a tutorial. I don't  really know that much as to write a tutorial myself. I am still a  beginner.<br />So let me start with it. I have had a good idea of C programming and  can code basic stuff in it. I noticed that even thought I had been  learning C from quite a lot of time, I cannot really do much in it. Just  some basic operations. I agree that the memory level access that C  gives cannot be matched by other languages that I know, but then I was  paying a quite high price for this privilege.<br />I needed to make a decision at this stage. Whether to keep learning C  with a hope that someday I will learn it all, get good with all the  memory and stack concepts, and will be able to code my complex  applications or to start with a different language, a much higher level  one. I googled and googled. Read lot of stuff on reputed forums and  discussion boards. I was finally convinced to drop C temporarily and  start with a new language. Then when I get mature enough with all memory  management concepts, I can come back to it and learn it all.<br />Hence starts my expedition to search for a new language. There are  numerous to be honest, but I wanted to go with a highly supported and  used language, so that I would have proper documentation to refer. I  already knew basics of Perl and PHP, but I always felt they are less  programming and more of the scripting type of languages. Java is  something I stay away from, and I am still to discover the reason for  it. I own a RaspberryPi, which, if you don't know, is a credit card  sized PC, which is used by enthusiasts of all kinds to experiment on. If  you read a thread or two on their official forum, you will quickly  realize that Python is the language of choice for the people developing  hobist projects on their Pi-s. So, I thought, there is something good  about this language. I read further and found out that this language has  a vast collection of built-in and third party libraries which can help  you will pretty much everything you do in Python. Moreover, I found out  that it also includes a dedicated raspberryPi library to control the  GIPOs of the Pi. Impressive, isn't it?<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">So Python was it. Next what?  </blockquote>I knew one thing for sure, that I will never be short on resources  for reading about python language. Firing up a google search confirmed  it. The documentation on their <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/">official site</a> is too good, but the problem is, it is a bit too advanced for newbies to understand.<br />Searching a bit more, I found something much more for me. It was a  book called "How to think like a Computer Scientist with Python". It is  an open and free book, and you can get it anywhere. Here is a link if  you are interested. <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf">http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf</a><br />I am currently on this book and I have got a fine idea of what this  language is and what not. Hope I finish up with it soon. Till then, keep  learning!</div>
