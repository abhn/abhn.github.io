<p>Hello again, and this post is in continuation of the previous post, <a href="http://www.nagekar.com/2015/10/CSS-Crash-Course.html">CSS Crash Course</a>. If you are wondering what the next stuff mean, you should probably check out the previous article. Anyways, in this post, I will list the most common use cases that you are likely to encounter in lighweight frontend designing. Writing this article more like a cheatsheet, so there is no particular order to the sections.</p>

<h3>Centering a DIV</h3>
{% highlight css %}
#div {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 980px;
}
{% endhighlight %}
