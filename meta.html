<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>I just keep doing stuff I love. I write about what I do, and sometimes, about people who annoy me. For anything, contact me at <b>abhishek[at]nagekar[dot]com</b></p>
<p>Also, I use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cyb3rvip3r" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/abhisheknagekar" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AbhishekNagekarMe" target="_blank">Google Plus</a>, if you would like to talk. I love to code applications in C++/Qt and sometimes Python. I also love to develop web applications, and use variety of frameworks in many languages which I am not very good at. Anyways, if you love code, you should totally check out my <a href="https://github.com/abhn" target="_blank">Github</a> where I post little projects I do.</p>

<h3>Terms, Privacy and Affiliates</h3>
<h4>Affiliations</h4>
<p>I always like to be transparent with what is content and what not. For example, advertisement banners will never mix with images anywhere on the blog. They will always be separate and distinguishable. Since I use some services that I write about, there may be an occasional affiliate link, which, if you follow and buy something, will earn me a part of the net amount as commission. Affiliate links will be clearly marked 'affiliated' with no exceptions. There would NEVER be an article for the sake of affiliation or marketing, ever, just to make it clear.</p>
<h4>Adsense</h4>
<p>My blog displays <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start/how-it-works.html" target="_blank">Google Adsense</a> banners at places. These ads collect information about your browsing habits and display relevant advertisements to you. You can <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/142293?hl=en" target="_blank">opt-out</a> of the network if you wish to, though that won't stop the ads from appearing. You can always use an Adblocker, but then you're not supporting me or those countless publishers who produce good content for others by investing their time, for free.<p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>I do not personally collect any information about the viewers, not even any kind of analytics. However, <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus Commenting System</a> is embedded in the post pages which track it's traffic with <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>.</p>
