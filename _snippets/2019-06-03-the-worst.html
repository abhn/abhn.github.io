  It is no secret that I'm a huge fan of this guy. For my first snippet, I'd like to put down a few quotes from one of my favorite articles of his.
</p>
<p>
  Often, I browse shopping sites like Amazon for no reason, looking at exotic gadgets and accessories, convincing myself I need them. Slowly, I am convinced and they end up in my cart, staring back at me. During such an impulse, I open this particular article and give it a read. It helps cure that temporary surge of materialism. I highly recommend you read <a href="https://moxie.org/blog/the-worst/">"The Worst" by Moxie Marlinspike</a>.

  ...an emphasis on the consumption of material goods can easily translate into a life of generalized consumption. A whole language can start to develop around not just the consumption of goods, but the consumption of experience: "We did Prague.” “We did Barcelona."

  "The best moments of my life, I never want to live again."

<blockquote>
  ...no matter how much research they do, a partisan of the best might not ever know as much about motorcycles as the partisan of the worst who takes a series of hare-brained cross-country motorcycle trips on a bike that barely runs, and ends up learning a ton about how to fix their constantly breaking bike along the way.
